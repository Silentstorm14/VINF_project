13,B000FA64PK,"[0, 0]",3,"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600

21,B000FA64QO,"[0, 0]",2,"With Ylesia, a novella originally published in e-book form, Walter Jon Williams gets an opportunity to insert further story into his novel Destiny's Way. The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Minor New Jedi Order side story,1331769600

However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14), which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel, so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises.","05 17, 2011",AQZH7YTWQPOBE,Enjolras,A Thrackan story,1305590400

27,B000FBFMVG,"[5, 5]",3,"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.","08 25, 2008",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee,1219622400

This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

35,B000FC1BN8,"[1, 1]",3,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).","09 24, 2010",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Enjoyable Imperial slice-of-life story,1285286400

42,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",2,"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me.","01 17, 2013",A1YEPFLLH42OU1,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""",An average short story,1358380800
43,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",5,"I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

Since then I have read several more of L'Amour's books and have enjoyed all of them.  I will review them here over the next few weeks, time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras ""aphorisms"", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word ""psychic"", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase ""judicial action"" to connote ""reflection-free"".  He's fond of the word ""unwisdom"", which Hartranft translates as ""not seeing things as they are"".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.","06 21, 2014",A6J7GN6ZOR085,lonebeaut,Compare and contrast for a better understanding,1403308800

L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.","06 11, 2013",A1U360OMVQRPUB,Mel Odom,Brionne,1370908800

For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.","03 3, 2012",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey",1330732800

First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.

After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.

No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article.

93,B000GFK7L6,"[7, 8]",3,"When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.","12 8, 2010",A30YCQ4MOZAI6Y,Michelle R,I love the NYT -- sometimes.

However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.

I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.

I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess).

If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there).

114,B000JMKNQ0,"[4, 4]",4,"Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order,1331769600

This time, Karen Traviss combines fan favorite Boba Fett and NJO favorite Nom Anor to show the Mandalorians' role in the Yuuzhan Vong war. Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical, but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.Even for a short story, it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more, or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion.

This is more of Karen Traviss' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty, infallible, infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians, who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual, Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story. This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books. You're lucky if she doesn't tell you how, when, and where Boba acquired his underwear, and what they're made of.Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of Traviss' work. I consider her Star Wars books to be a notch below Barbara Hambly's disastrous efforts. Read this only if you're a huge fan of Traviss, or a huge fan of Non-Canon Star Wars books... Because this one can't stand up to scrutiny.","08 13, 2009",A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,A Good Reason Not to Miss Traviss' Star Wars Books,1250121600

When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.  I would have loved to read more of her work in a Star Wars setting.","05 18, 2013",A12LKEM543ILBK,zombie phreak,Terrific!!!,1368835200

I kept wanting to say, ""Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.""The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.  While this is an exciting story, I never really cared if the characters lived or died except for what would happen to the child.","10 17, 2009",A109E01LB4H38F,"Carol Donaho ""Carol Donaho""",Way too fast!,1255737600

Pooter, a senior bank clerk in the City renting a home in a London suburb of Holloway, encapsulates Victorian respectability, snobbery, and pretensions. Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours. What's a father to do?First serialized in Punch in 1888 and 1889, The Diary of a Nobody was published in book form in 1892 and hasn't been out of print since.

It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow.

This book was written during World War 1. The Western Front in the subtitle is the line where the westward-moving German army was being met by the armies of the countries they were invading. Arnold Bennett was a novelist who was Director of Propaganda for France at the Ministry of Information during the war. That's the background, on to the book...Bennett tells of the time he spent moving from town to town in France and Belgium along the Front. He is always escorted by a military officer, and they often walk through trenches and have to take cover if an artillery shell explodes nearby. He frequently goes into detail about towns and buildings that have been damaged or destroyed by the Germans. It's not a very personal book- he seldom writes about people he meets or relates conversations. Occasionally he muses on the absurdity of what the Germans are doing, and what it is costing in terms of people's lives and livelihoods. His cynicism shines through at those moments. The book will be best enjoyed by war buffs, but it's short, and an excellent description of a war zone, so I recommend it to people who don't normally read war books as well.","04 5, 2010",A39A6B9YR9R0L6,Phil,Life on the Western Front during World War 1,1270425600

To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.

Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.","07 30, 2011",A5CA9579GD7HJ,Bob Jarvis,Handyman's Journal,1311984000

""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist. This book is a classic for a reason.","02 12, 2011",AFFGYGNO989PD,"Elizabeth H. Cottrell ""RiverwoodWriter""",Rollicking adventure,1297468800

It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale.

The only complaint was that there was a lot of detail put into all the different mechanisms they had to make.

They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties.

Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the ""what one book would you want with you on a desert island?"" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt ""Smith"" was a ""gypsy name"" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character. You can find that version in the kindle store here:The Mysterious Island)Oh, yeah, Captain Nemo. This book is in some ways a sequel to Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas_, as well as to his _In Search of the Castaways_. The sequence isn't direct -- really more a case of cameo characters than a direct plot sequel to either book -- but you might want to read those two books first before picking this one up.","06 11, 2010",A1KPDKD7VYRE3B,T.

It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.","07 18, 2010",A50EGYZY7RHGI,"Brian K.

Sure, the money is for admin fees..a joke. He cries continually over money and references fees all around.

359,B000JQUSBQ,"[3, 4]",5,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary.

361,B000JQUSBQ,"[42, 45]",4,"There are twenty-nine stories in this collection. These Indian tales resemble the stories that flourished in Europe, such as the tales by the Brothers Grimm and by Aesop, although they have an Indian flavor. The collector of these stories contends that they are very old, older than the legends and folk-tales that later flourished in Europe. He believes that India was the originator of this genre and the stories were possibly brought to Europe by the crusaders or other travelers that passed through India.For example, the tale The Lion and the Crane is well-known. A lion was eating an animal when a bone got stuck in its throat. A crane offered to help if the lion promises not to eat it. The lion agrees. The crane protects itself by placing a stick in the lion's mouth to keep it open while he is inside the lion's mouth removing the bone. As soon as the crane removes the bone, it pushes out the stick and flies off to a high tree. Later, the crane asks the lion what the lion will give it for saving the lion's life. The lion responds that it already gave the crane a gift by not eating it. The Indian version ends by speaking about the transmigration of souls, a belief of many Indians. The lion and the crane were people in another life.How the Raja's Son Won the Princess Labam is another example of a familiar tale, although known in the west under other names. A prince goes in search for a beautiful princess. While journeying, he takes out his food and finds an ant in it. He places it on the ground for other ants to come and finish it. The ant Raja arrives and tells him that since he fed the ants, if he needs help in the future all he need do is think of them and they will come to help him. He leaves and continues searching for the princess. He comes across a tiger with a thorn in its paw. He helps the tiger who tells the prince that if he needs help in the future, he should think of him, and he and his wife will come and help him. The prince continues his search and comes across four fakirs with four magic items: a bag that give food whenever it is requested to do so, a bowl that offers water, a bed that flies and can take the prince where he wants to go, and a stick that will beat any group that tries to harm him. He takes the four items from the fakirs. He uses the bed to go to the princess. He uses the bag and bowl for food and drink. He then uses the ants and tigers and the bed when the princess' father insists that he performs tasks before he will give up his daughter. The final fourth task that the father insists that he perform is one that none of his friends or magical items can help him with. But the princess tells him how to do the task. The story ends by stating that the two lived happily and never needed to use the magic stick.","10 15, 2010",A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,Israel Drazin,Delightful stories that are similar to European tales,1287100800

381,B000JQUT8S,"[0, 0]",3,"Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' most liked and popular novels.Authors, let this be a lesson to you -- create terrific villains.Oliver Twist himself is a twerpy nobody 90% of the books. Okay, he asks for a second bowl of gruel. He fights to defend the good name of his mother. He walks to London in a week. That's all good, but it's all in the first quarter of the book.Afterward he does nothing but get entrapped by criminals. And be such an obvious goody-goody he becomes the friend of the victims instead.Indeed, the man who has a handkerchief stolen by the other two boys, and the family Bill Sykes tries to use Twist to rob turn out to be not only current friends but related to his real family.No author today could get away with such outrageous coincidences.The ending is a sentimental mishmash. He has a half-brother who hates him, and people are involved in complicated plots I could neither follow nor believe.What makes this novel live on is the portrait of Fagin the leader of a gang of child thieves. And the violent robber Bill Sykes and his girlfriend the prostitute (though you have to read between the lines to figure this out), who started with Fagin as a thief when only 4.Although he avoids direct sexual subjects, Dickens otherwise nothing to pretty up the reality of London's underworld of crime and poverty. Dickens got Twist out of this environment as fast as he could, but was wise to keep going back to the criminals, who are the only interesting people in this novel.Dear sweet Oliver and Rose just make us gag.","03 3, 2012",AS6HL0VD7H8PA,"Richard Stooker ""Author, Virgin Blood""",Great villains,1330732800

389,B000JQUTGK,"[0, 0]",4,"This book filled a lot of gaps in the Lincoln story.  It consists of a series of anecdotes remembered by contemporaries of Abe Lincoln.  Many are humorous  stories or jokes that he liked to tell and many are reiterated by more than one person.  Some are sayings lifted out of speeches that he made, especially that occurred during the Lincoln/Douglas debates.  These stories are more or less placed in chronological order from Abe's boyhood days through his whole life experience and end the evening of his assassination as he prepared to go to the Ford Theater.  These saying as remembered as coming from the very mouth of the to be 16th President prove that his was a life-long aversion to slavery in all of its forms.  I have read opinions that his interest was in the preservation of the Union more than the end of slavery, but I think these quotes from Lincoln's own mouth show his horror and outrage against slavery from his early manhood, not to minimize his desire to preserve the Union.Another area is Lincoln's faith.  These stories from Abe's own mouth show his devout faith in Christianity, the Bible, and prayer from his boyhood, and his ever intensifying faith as the horrors of the Civil War ran their course.  I have read opinions by contemporaries in his law-practice days that Lincoln was an atheist or at best an agnostic.  No statements of that nature come from Abraham's mouth in this book, and if at all true would seem to reflect a stage of questioning in his early professional days before he became a candidate for office.Several more observations can be made:  I did not know that he had been in love twice before the alliance with Mary Todd.  One girl named Anne or Annie had been engaged to someone from the East before she was enamored with Lincoln.  The eastern swain had gone back east to get permission from his relatives as he considered himself to be of a higher class and needed the permission of his family in order to marry the western Annie.  During the absence of the Easterner, Annie sickened and died.  Abe was devastated.  He wept at her grave and was disconsolate for a long time.  Mary Todd was his third love.  I hadn't remembered that  another suitor of Mary's was Douglas, the Little Giant, Lincoln's political rival.  Douglas was short, round, and well-dressed.  Most would have predicted that he would be Mary's choice, however, she unpredictably picked Lincoln, the ungainly, rustic giant.  It was commented that Mary saw the diamond inside the rough exterior.Another interesting thread was the many threats and assassination attempts that were made against Lincoln's life from the beginning of his political success and his unconcern about them.  He stated that he believed his life was secure until his Maker called for it.  He astounded people by evading his body guards and taking unusual risks.  In the last days of the war, he visited the front lines against all advice.  By the time the hue and cry arose to forbid such a risky act, he had already been there and safely returned.This collection was evidently put together and edited quite close to time of the events.  Much of the language is archaic to my ear, and when explanations are made to help the reader understand, they are still geared to a much earlier generation.  Some of the jokes lost their humor for me because of the archaic language.  At that time, the general public evidently thought that three of our presidents had been poisoned for political ends as their vice presidents would be more favorable to the desired policies.  These stories were not given as controversial but as the accepted opinion of the day and were mentioned to show that there were grounds to believe the story of a White House kitchen worker who said he had been offered a large amount of money to poison the milk of the Lincoln household.  (The teetotaler family drank milk as their favored beverage.)  The poisoned presidents were considered to have been William Harrison, and the Generals Taylor and Scott.","03 1, 2014",A3H10TBPGHYSII,"Patricia C.

395,B000JQUU00,"[0, 0]",4,"In my review, I'm more comparing how this book meets my expectations based on what I have read from the more well known fairy tale compilers like the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson.  Some of these English fairy tales are very familiar, but they are not always quite how I know them.The first impression I had was that this book is more varied in terms of 'fairy tales'.  There are a lot of folk tales, and silly children's stories that don't have any moral or resolution really (""Master of all Masters springs to mind, as a short tale that seems to have the point of reciting silly words).  There is also a fixation on the name Jack for a lot of these characters.  I just thought that was interesting.  I wonder if they are all the same person.  There is also references to King Arthur and his court which I found very fascinating because some of these tales seem grounded in realistic detail.  They mention Kings who reigned and real locations in England as having seen the events in the story.  It makes the tales a little less fantastical, even when there are giants roaming the English countryside.Probably the tale that most surprised me was the story of Dick Whittington which now I realize I confused with the French ""Puss in Boots"" fairy tale.  Dick Whittington's story is much less magical, and more about being lucky enough to have a very industrious cat who likes to hunt mice.  ""Mr. Fox"" kind of stood out to me for its implied romance, gruesomeness, and the confrontation by the heroine. There are not too many stories in this book that are the same ilk. And lastly a story that I was surprised to see included was ""The Golden Arm"" which I was always more familiar with as a ghost story.  But now I know it is definitely a very old one.With the more realistic settings, sometimes whimsical nature of a few tales, and the English slang that is used at times, this book of fairy tales is rather different from what I'm used to.  I find it very interesting to read the original of familiar tales and see how things have changed.  For instance ""The Story of the Three Bears"" is more familiar to readers as ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears.""  In the original story there is no Goldilocks - rather the intruder is a very disagreeable old woman.  This book is definitely worth a read, for something different than the usual stories and perhaps to find some new favorite fairy tales.","04 23, 2013",A1Q434SYE6K31Q,Charlene,"Surprising, intriguing and wonderful",1366675200

397,B000JQUU00,"[21, 22]",5,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""once upon a time."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.","12 9, 2010",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,A Great Collection of Fairy Tales,1291852800

They met on their wedding day for the first time; exchanged vows; and the next morning he left joining the army.Seven years later, Mallory is tossed from her home due no payment as her wandering husband's uncle stopped sending her allotment.  Fuming, Mallory comes to London to confront her husband and demand a divorce.  Not caring one iota for proper behavior, she rips his head off in front of his mistress.  When John realizes the screaming crone is his wife, he grabs her and leaves his mistress at home. Mallory proves he owns nothing as his fortune has been embezzled while he dallied.  Together they seek his missing relative who absconded with his money.

There's a dash of humor, a strong romance, and a nicely woven plot with good tension between the protagonists.Mallory and John meet on their wedding day.  Mallory is only sixteen and John just a few years older, they are uncertain of each other and resentful as their parents have arranged their marriage.  John must marry Mallory so she can keep her beloved castle and John marries Mallory out of duty (he does not want to see her lose her home) and out of a need to please his father, a man who publicly claims John but privately eschews him because he is not really his flesh and blood.The day after the wedding John leaves and joins the military determined to forge his own destiny and not the one dictated by his father.  Over the years he sends Mallory funds through his uncle but basically lives his own life without laying eyes on his wife.  He returns to England and is a sought after lover and quite the man about town.Mallory finds John in London, in his mistress's house no less, demanding a divorce.  She has lost her home to creditors and she is infuriated at her husband.  John is astounded to see Mallory and even more surprised to learn that she has no home and that he is deeply in debt.  Seems his uncle has been siphoning off his funds and even worse loan sharks are circling him.  John knows he could go to debtor's prison if he does not find his uncle who has conveniently skipped town.  As his wife, Mallory could suffer the same fate so they now are on the run.John's friend lands them a job on one of his family estates, John will become a steward while his friend hunts down his uncle.  Mallory agrees to this plan mostly because she feels she has no choice, she wants to avoid prison.At first it was almost impossible to like John; he was selfish and irresponsible.  Mallory is completely justified in her feelings.  Their time as estate managers brings out the best of both characters and also their insecurities.  John realizes he is self centered and thoughtless; Mallory confronts her lonely life and takes a hard look at her reserved manner with commoners.  John is likable, smooth and smart and best of all sincere, when he feels something he does not hold back.  Mallory is more cautious, after all she was the abandoned one in the marriage and she is also uncertain in social situations, she lacks John's natural charm.  She gets beyond these hindrances and grows into a much more confident woman.  As she understands her husband her heart opens to him more each day.  This is a sweet romance about discovery, the leads not only discover how much they love each other but they also discover how to become better people too.","09 27, 2010",A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,Melissa,Romantic tale of a husband and wife falling in love,1285545600

Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).

Zangara made Seaton House an exclusive hotel in the nineteen thirties and was later convicted of being a serial killer.  Lottie is overprotected by her five older brothers, so she is relishing the idea of solving a mystery or two while relaxing and hopefully finding a hot guy to fool around with while she's at it.  Arriving at Seaton House during a thunderstorm, Lottie meets Simon and falls instantly in lust but Simon clearly wants nothing to do with her.  Lottie's not giving up though; she plans to discover the mystery surrounding the house and Simon, all while trying to seduce him into bed, but strange things are happening.

The effect was jarring to me, and I really wanted to skip whole chapters, especially when she's describing her own body as ""hot"" and centerfold worthy. Made her a lot less likable.  Then there are the continuity issues. In chapter 3 her internal monologue includes, ""Mr. Lebeaux. God, I didn't even know his first name.""  Then a few pages later ""the portable lantern Simon had left..."" half a page later ""hoping Simon would suddenly remember..."" so you think, well maybe she does know his name after all. Then in the next chapter she asks him ""What's your name?...Your first name."" There's a couple of other gaffs too but that one nearly made me give up on the book.The heroine goes back and forth between contemplating how many guys she's been with in college to then saying things like ""I don't have a lot of experience at this,"" when she's underneath the hero.

There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".

Like the handful of other Kindle newspapers I've experienced, the Kindle edition of the International Herald Tribune is laid out well, is easy to navigate, and features a generous allotment of photographs.  I'd be tempted to buy it more often, or maybe even subscribe, if the subscription and/or single-issue price was just a bit lower.

I find myself learning about global issues that normally are not even touched on in the usual ""lowest common denominator"" fare on TV. Happenings in the arts and sciences are also covered.The Nation comes out once a week, which I find to be a good rate of publication for a magazine of this type. You don't get the breathless ""breaking news"" type of reporting (a la Wolf Blitzer) in The Nation, which I find refreshing, but the issues are current and usually of considerable importance. The editors have time to be editors and the writers have time to do their homework. It's a more measured, intelligent approach to the world than we've gotten used to with cable news and screaming-head blogs.I do not find The Nation to be all that left-wing. On the contrary, I find a balance of perspectives from left (mostly left-of-center) to center-right. Importantly, there are no ""Screaming of the Extremists"" portions. There are well-articulated viewpoints and the occasional intelligent debate.

You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.

You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.

(I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.

Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs.

Blonde hair, a figure to die for; she haunts his dreams and invades his waking moments.  He yearns to make her the love of his life and the mother of his children.  When he finds out she is moving back to town, his heart jumps for joy, all the while knowing that she probably won't even look at a man like him.Veronica Abbott has to get out from under her parents control, even though she has been married and widowed.  Moving back to her hometown, she decides to open a romance shop.  Taking a basket to the local fire department as a thank you for saving her childhood home from burning down, Veronica walks into the locker room and comes face to face with Dean Wolcott; the object of her secret teenage crush.  Veronica then proceeds to show him just how much she has missed him and is attracted to him.Dean wants Veronica with every ounce of his being.  He doesn't want to be her part time lover, he wants to be the love of her life forever.  He promises to give her time but is unsure if a girl like her will ever love him.Caught Off Guard was a naughty look at two people whose childhood crushes were still alive and strong years later.  I fell in love with Dean completely and absolutely because his intentions were so loving and so honorable.  I found myself wincing with Veronica's mannerisms and blatant sexuality, but after realizing how she wanted to finally be free from being controlled, I could see where she was coming from.  Caught Off Guard by Tonya Ramagos was a delightful read.

As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...Robert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.Lady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.Fortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.ARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.

EVERYTHING Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Sherlock Holmes is here: all 4 novels and all 56 short stories. The informative introduction by Loren D. Estleman is an added bonus (though it appears twice in this ebook version, once at the start of each of the 2 volumes as originally published in paperback by Bantam). This ebook edition is very well-formatted, comfortable to read, has an active TOC (in which the short stories are presented in proper order), and even accurately depicts the graphic representations in ""The Dancing Men,"" unlike many other versions which substitute the word ""graphics"" for the drawings. This is undoubtedly the very best Sherlock Holmes collection currently available in the Kindle Store. (The non-Holmes set of 10 ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is sometimes added to incomplete Holmes sets to boost their story total. There is no need for this complete Sherlock Holmes set to do so, but if you want it, ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is easily obtained separately as a public domain freebie in the Kindle Store.) So if you love reading these beloved classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries, this is THE ebook edition to purchase--and paying only $2.99 for Bantam quality (rather than going with some incomplete, unauthorized, no-name, ebook bundler) is a very good deal.ADDENDUM: Since the above was written Maplewood Books has come out with a now updated and truly complete edition of its own at 1/3 the price of this Bantam version.

It has a really nice mix of stuff - how better to say, it's kind of interesting musings about all kinds of things, not just books or technology.The postings are very well written, as we'd expect from Amazon. The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint. If you happen to not read this blog for about 2 days, the old postings disappear. And there's no way to go reload them. So if on Thursday, I've forgetten to or not bothered to read Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday postings - most certainly there will be no Monday material. Tuesday has a shot at an article or two if the Thursday entry is small. Wednesday will be there. It's just not much fun to not be able to read old posts.Oh it does not feed to iPhone.So this blog is free. Well how can anybody really complain? I'm an almost daily reader now.Apparently this blog is somewhere on Amazon, my best efforts to search for it could not find it.

603,B000R93D4Y,"[8, 8]",4,"Magical, Mystical, Sensual . . . Enjoyable! While definitely all about the sex, this story brings a clear plot and a well-thought world in which our heroes and heroine have the pleasure of interacting. Perhaps I should say heroes and heroines . . . as the dragons are most certainly a major player in the plot of the story.There is never any inter-species hanky panky occurring, but the plot outlines a world where the dragon and its rider are so connected that both the dragon and rider are able to share feelings - including the sexual urges and desire that occur when the dragon is coupling with its mate. Of course, those feelings are intense, and of course they last for a very long time. (Dragons may be able to keep it in check for a very long time, but when they let loose . . . one should apparently be ready for almost anything!)The shared feelings and a lack of available females leads to an openness within the community around sex, and while there is no voyeurism involved, interaction may not be entirely behind closed doors . . . especially during a wedding! The lack of females also leads to an accepted practice of knights sharing mates - which is the case in this particular story. While there are sexual interactions between Gareth and Belara only, once Belara and her mother are brought back to the lair, that quickly changes, and Lars is added to the mix.There is an attempt made to slowly introduce the reader to multiple partners and all of the sexual exploits that situation can bring about. But, truly, there is lots and lots of sex in many different ways, shapes and forms. Outside of the sex, the plot does continue, and there is an epic battle scene described, and Belara's mother encounters the healing powers of a dragon. It's after this battle that Belara finds her dragon healing powers, and further cements her place within the community.A brief note: I was not especially happy with the ending of this story. It is a ""happily for now"", but it does set itself up to lead directly into a new book . . . a continuation of the story. Although not labeled as part of a series, the front cover lists the story as ""Dragon Knights"" - leading me to believe we will encounter this dragon community again, if not these particular characters again. That isn't a bad thing.A nice combination of fantasy and sex, this book is a nice one to pick up and lose yourself in!

It's the first I've read by Bianca D'Arc but based on this I might try more of her work in the future.Bolera is 18 and lives alone with her mother. She's out hunting a deer one day when, right after she shot it in the heart with her arrow, a dragon comes down and takes off with her deer. She chases him and finds where he lands and starts insisting that he give her back the deer. Instead of giving it back, the dragon carries her off...Gareth is a knight and the rider/partner of a dragon. He's surprised to find his dragon, Kelvan, flying in the a young woman along for the ride. Kelvan informs Gareth that she can hear dragon thoughts (a requirement for a mate to a dragon's knight) and leaves her there with Gareth. Gareth feels an attraction to her immediately and seduces her, realizing she's his true mate.Gareth convinces Bolera (and her mother) to come back to the Lair with them for a visit (although he has every intention of convincing her to stay). Because it's a ""mating"" that has a mystical element it's pretty much a ""love at first sight"" for them both and Bolera agrees to be Gareth's wife (aka mate). There are added intricacies that comes with knight/dragon matings that Bolera has to accept. When Bolera and Gareth mate it gives Kelvan the ability to claim his mate (dragon's can't before their knight's have mates because the mating fever would drive the knights mad otherwise). Now that Gareth found Bolera, Kelvan can claim his mate, Rohtina (a female dragon). Rohtina's knight is Lars. By tradition, both knights become husbands to the woman...in this case Bolera. It's actually pretty easy because of the whole mutual mystical attraction thing they have going. Bolera is a bit freaked by the idea of 2 men but is also attracted to both and has a hard time resisting. She does accept them and they merge in to a family (Bolera, Gareth, Lars, Kelvan and Rohtina).There is a bit of an action plot in the story due to an upcoming war with the neighboring country. There are creatures (being sent over b the enemy country) that are causing issues and the dragons have been sent to deal with them. At one point, there's a skirmish with the creatures and Rohtina is badly hurt. Bolera ends up being the one to save her and finds out some interesting possibilities on her origins along with the possibility of finding her lost twin sisters. The story concludes in a nice HEA.This was an enjoyable read. I liked the world and the dragon mythos. It's a cool premise and the rest of the series looks interesting.","08 31, 2013",A10DX94ATZQEFG,"Malinda ""I love books and love to get lost in...",Good dragon rider menage story,1377907200

I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.","02 21, 2014",AR6U5BOVA5PYY,Mishel (P.S.

When the noble dragon, Kelvan, inadvertently enters herlife, Belora's future takes a sharp turn.Because of Belora's ability to communicate with dragons, Kelvanrecognizes her for the special woman that she is.

He has been fightingagainst the evils in his land with Kelvan as his partner, for a longwhile. Upon meeting Belora, Gareth feels instant attraction, and notesthat it is mutual. Because of the shortage of wives for the knights,life in the Border Lair is a far cry from the beliefs with which Belorawas raised. Gareth can only hope that Belora is able to accept thetraditions in the Lair if she recognizes Gareth as her mate.Maiden Flight is a fantasy with a dash of drama and a lot of heat,which completely fascinated me, but not in the way I expected.

617,B000R93D4Y,"[0, 1]",2,"I just can't drag my rating any higher than a 2 star here. I acknowledge that despite my love of dragons and erotica I might not have been the best reader for this book. This is one of those books in which everyone is always spouting off wonderful affirmations and bad things never really happen. Despite the storyline, it's like being stuck in a church van full of kumbaya -singing mormons who only want to help you see how wonderful you really are. The feel-good factor starts to chafe after a while.I think there is a plot that encompasses the whole series (of which there are now 7 books and 3 novellas). It's obvious that war is brewing, royal progeny are going to spring up somewhere, ect. However, there didn't really seemed to be a single plot contained within this book itself, other than lots and lots of sex. Unfortunately I didn't even think all that sex was particularly hot. It lacked details and a lot of it was same-same (for example H1 and H2 never even changed positions).Plus everything moves exceedingly fast. Insta-lust isn't even fast enough to describe it. Within the course of one brief conversation the h and H1 met, fell in love and dispensed with her virginity. Within two days he has asked her to marry him, introduced a third party (H2) to the mix and convinced her to be comfortable with all the other voyeuristic knights. Within a day of that she's rolling with the double penetration, draconic aphrodisiacs and apparently learned to have multiple orgasms a the drop of a freakin' hat with little to no for-play. I know this is erotica. I know I have to suspend my disbelief. I know it's fantasy and all in good fun. But seriously, I could not make myself believe anything could move so quickly.I did like H1 and H2 (H2 probably most of all). I like the mother and Jarred. I liked the dragons. I liked the interesting Wyre life...sorry Lair life. The idea of two men per woman is an interesting one, though male pairing would seem easier. (I don't think I'm the first review to point either aspect out.) I didn't care for the h though. The h, I might point out, who isn't even important enough to have her own name in the book's description, so you can imagine how much effect she has in the book. No, despite liking many of the disparate part of the book I didn't like the book as a whole. Others do. I can't say I cared much for it.","07 10, 2013",AUF0OPKICU6D4,Sadie Forsythe,not for me,1373414400
618,B000R93D4Y,"[11, 12]",3,"Reading the reviews before purchasing this, the first in the series, I was shocked at the negative responses.  I have always enjoyed Bianca's work, so it was out of character to see such reviews.Based on my past experience with her work, combined with my love of dragons, I decided to give the series a shot.  Granted, there is a lot of sex, but this is to be expected for the genre Bianca writes in.  This is an adult romance story & not for kids, which I read as a complaint in a few of the reviews.  How anyone could think otherwise, I have no idea, as it's obvious in the description this book contains sexual situations.Also, many reviewers commented on dragon-human sex.  I did not see this at all, rather the dragons matings affect their human-bonded warriors; I saw nothing untoward about this.  The reviewers made it sound as if the dragons and humans were having sex.  Nothing could be further from the truth.If you know this is an erotic story, with frequent sexual scenes, then you should know what to expect.  As for the story, I found I enjoyed the characters.  The dragons had a surprising amount of humanity, which I enjoyed.  The warriors were strong, capable, sexy men.  There were a lot of sex scenes, no question.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if there was more to the story than sex, as not much occurred beyond their meeting and mating until the very end.Bianca has always had wonderful world and character building, with a great plot.  This story lacked the complexity of her normal writing for me, thus the three star rating.  Other than this, I found the reviews to be unfounded.The best advice I can give regarding this story is, if you have enjoyed this Author's writing, you will likely like this, more for the potential as a continuing series than for this story specifically.  If you have no experience with this Author, I would recommend not judging all of her work based off of this story.  Her work, as a whole is incredible.As an Author myself, I know we don't always hit a home run.  It's not a bad story, it's simply not her best work.  However, I am excited for the future of this series, as I see the potential exists for amazing stories to come.  As I write this review, I believe she is on the seventh book of the series.I would suggest, if it sounds interesting, or like something that may interest you, give it a try.  Do not let the negative reviews alter your opinions of the Author, her work as a whole, or this story in specific.  To do so would be an injustice to a very creative and successful Author.As for me, because I see the potential in the series, I will purchase the next book and see for myself.  I have faith in this Author's writing abilities enough to spend three dollars and change for a chance to see where she takes the series.Also, there were several remarks made of the positive reviews being made all by paid reviewers.  To clarify, as an Author we do not pay reviewers, or pay for reviews.  People who review books are provided with an ARC (advanced reader's copy) so they can read & review prior to publication date.  This is done for many reasons, some being for the benefit of the reader (so they have an opinion to read on a new book), others for the Author (so they can get first-hand feedback early on from people who do nothing but read in their genre).Making an accusation of paying for reviews is harsh, unfounded and discredits the Author, reviewer, and the entire process.  We have no need to pay for reviews, and it would be a vast waste of (what little) resources and time we have.  After all, when the book hits the market, if the reading public does not like it, no amount of positive reviews from reviewers will change this.Also, I would like to point out the fact that most Authors have no say in which reviewers their book is sent to, as this is often a decision made and completely handled by the publisher.  As an Author, I am given so many copies of my book to distribute, but these are used for promotional purposes only (like a contest).  I am not allowed to distribute these books to reviewers.  This is in my contract.  So, to this end, making a claim of paying for reviews again has no foundation.I know this explanation has nothing to do with the story itself, but I felt it necessary to clarify, based off of some (poor) reviews, and their comments.  Especially given, if your profession is not that of an Author, you would likely not know how reviewers are handled.In ending, I'm off to purchase the next in the series; I know Bianca's writing, and I am confident she will take this series in great directions.Enjoy!  =)Shelbie Knightwww.shelbieknight.com","06 11, 2013",A1ZAPFF4YQ4IPJ,"Shelbie Knight ""Shelbie Knight =)""",Make your own decision,1370908800

626,B000R93D4Y,"[18, 18]",4,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora.

But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper. I just wish the story of Angie and Ryan could've happened without the m&eacute;nage with Wade. It just didn't seem necessary and it felt like a dark spot on their beginning.

The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series, I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand, I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha.

The writing is solid, if mildly uninspired, and the scenario could be very interesting, but it's tough to buy the whole 'spy who longs for a normal life falls in love with a grifter with a heart of gold' concept. Perhaps if there'd been more time to develop their relationship...but as it was, they meet, fall in love in day and go off to Switzerland on a ski vakay. Sorry, but that's a tough nut to swallow. We're talking about two people who lie for a living trusting each other implicitly. Yeah, right.As noted, there is a lot of potential for interesting and exotic sequels in this series, and I think anyone interested in the spy/romance genre would probably enjoy 'meeting' these new characters.

659,B000R93DPS,"[1, 1]",5,"Brody, formerly a special ops officer in the Marine Corp, is a 30-something Renaissance Literature professor with a thing for one of the students who just completed this semester's class.  Missy is 26 and working her way through college with dreams of going to medical school.  One night, when her crush, Professor Brody, comes into the adult store where Missy works, a little chit chat leads Brody to volunteer to teach Missy to play poker.  When a few friendly lessons in cards turn into lessons in the bedroom, Missy's inhibitions about her weight threaten to crush their relationship.  Can Brody convince Missy to up the ante and turn this two of a kind into a full house or will Missy fold instead?Do you remember those first few romance novels you read?  If you were at all like me, you snatched them from your mother (or aunt) and alternately grinned and giggled through them.  Part of it was because of the intimacy of the subject matter (even if the books were sedate compared to what you read today) and part of it was reading something maybe you shouldn't have been.  That's exactly what this book was like for me - I found myself grinning and giggling like a happy fool throughout the story.For me, this book had it all... a slightly dangerous, slightly possessive, handsy hero, a mouthy but shy-about-her-weight heroine, a whole lot of sexy banter, sweet but hot monkey love, and a couple of girlfriends (from previous books) that are supportive and maybe a little crazy.  I loved that Brody and Missy have a good time together, whether they're fooling around, fighting, or just having a simple conversation.  Brody is a little unreasonable sometimes, but Missy doesn't just let him run her over - she pushes back.  The back and forth repartee between Brody and his brother is funny and demonstrates their good relationship.Missy is somewhere around a size 16/18 (according to Brody's estimation, though a definitive size is never given for her).  As a result of the encouragement and self-confidence that Brody and her friends help to build up, Missy undergoes a bit of a physical transformation.  I can't explain, as a plus-sized woman, how thrilled I was to watch her change without having to lose weight and to see how well-received it was by her circle of friends.  So many stories about curvy heroines require that she loses weight to finally get the attention/love of the hero.  I was so pleased that Brody helped her to reveal this hidden part of herself while her curves remained unchanged.Since this book is listed as erotica, the story is explicit, but it's the parts outside of the proverbial bedroom that made this book so great to me.  When writing a story, an author can develop characters by telling you what they are like or by showing you.  For example, suppose you have a character that readers should believe is dangerous.  With ""telling"", the author has narrative in the story that basically says the Hero is dangerous - he used to be a Marine, he knows how to fight, etc.  With showing, there's a fight and the Hero takes on five armed men while he only has a broken pool stick.  With ""showing"", you get to experience and see for yourself that the character is who the author wants you to think they are.  It's much easier to tell readers about the hero/heroine, especially in erotica where so many authors think the storyline is just about the sex.  With this story, however, there's a magical balance of telling and showing.  We know Brody wants Missy, but then we get to see it.  He constantly touches her when they're together, he can scan a crowd to find her, he likes to hold her hand, he encourages her to be sexually open with him because he loves her body as is, etc.I've read several of Lena Matthews' books in the past and they're always well written with creative but still sweet love scenes.  This story was probably my favorite of her books and a fantastic value for the current (Kindle) price.  The story is probably a 3 to 4 hour read.  Highly recommended.","11 13, 2011",A88USYRFGDUTK,K.

The point about Brody being upset when Missy would make fun of herself and Brody's refusal to deal with it was mentioned so many times I grew tired of it. And I never really ""got"" why these two people became a couple. This one had less romantic attraction (in the beginning) than the other two in the series--it was more based on sexual attraction.

He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.

And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end. Fortunately, Ms. McKenna does treat us to Christina, Jon and JT's story in her follow up book - THE STRENGTH OF THREE - which is currently available.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 16, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

I usually really like this author and was disappointed by the book because it was just okay.  They story had a very interesting premise, but it was not fleshed out into the full story it deserved.  The shortness of the story makes Aislinn's capitulation a little too quick even though you know they have been working together for 6 months already. I would love to see this story worked out into a full novel by this author and see where it really goes.

681,B000R93E3E,"[14, 16]",5,"With an abusive ex-husband stalking her relentlessly, Aislinn has had to keep moving in order to stay out of his clutches.  She never stays in one town more than one month, remaining as unattached as possible so that leaving is easier to bear.  But when she takes a job at Turner Industries, staying isolated proves impossible as she finds herself irresistibly drawn to her employer, Kyle Turner III.  Still, she avoids becoming involved with him past their working relationship - that is, until her clairvoyant abilities show her a fatal vision involving Kyle!Kyle knows all about Aislinn's past, in minute detail.  Being ex-Special Forces and in the security industry, it is his business to know everything about the people close to him - especially pretty little personal assistants who distract him like no other woman can.  He has no intention of letting Aislinn run again, not when he can protect her from her past and keep her close to him, where she belongs...I do not think Annmarie McKenna can do wrong with a story.  I have loved every piece of her work I have read so far!  Two Sighted was a pleasure both to read and to write a review for.  It is books like this that make my job simple, and I wish they could all be this good.Kyle Turner III pushed every button I have, proving that this author knows just what women love in their heroes.  In fact, if you could place orders for men that would exactly suit your needs, I would want McKenna's help placing the order since she seems to know what I want better than I do myself!  Kyle is the epitome of the overprotective Alpha male who pursues the woman he loves with an unwavering focus and a sensitivity that belies his `he-man' status.Aislinn's fear and loneliness are palpable as she longs for those simple human comforts long denied her - a best friend, a phone call with her mother, a man to fall in love with, a home that is hers for longer than 8 months.  Yet even in her determination to remain detached, we see that she can't help but care about those around her.  While her abusive ex-husband may have stolen her sense of belonging, her hopes for a future, he hasn't robbed her of her empathy.  While it might be easy to be jealous of the woman who captures the attentions of the hunky Kyle, no one could begrudge Aislinn for stealing his heart.I was impressed with Annmarie McKenna's very first novel,Blackmailed, and my admiration for her work grows with each new release.  In Two Sighted, she effortlessly sets the stage for a sequel starring several of the supporting leaving her fans aching for it without leaving this book feeling unfinished in any way.  I know I will be hungrily snapping up any new releases both in this series and from this author!","12 1, 2007",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1196467200

Will Dolan make his move on Cait? Will Cait's father make her choose between the life she's always known and the future she could have with Cord?Take Me is the first story I've read by Mackenzie McKade and it won't be my last!  Cait is a character I would love to be friends with and who wouldn't want to spend a night in the arms of Cord and Dolan?  What impressed me most about Take Me (besides the sexy cowboys) is the natural emotional complications which arose after the trio's passionate encounter.  I dreamily sighed over Cord's possessiveness and I admired how Ms. McKade handled Dolan's attraction to Cait.  In the hands of another author, Dolan's desire to start a relationship with Cait might have annoyed me or detracted from the tale.  However, this is not the case; Ms. McKade deftly handles the emotions of all involved and I was more than happy with the story's ending.  Take Me is an engaging read, filled with likeable characters and deliciously hot love scenes.  Sinful, yet satisfying, I greatly enjoyed Ms. McKade's book.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","01 4, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Take Me,1262563200

741,B000SWV6HG,"[12, 14]",4,"I was so excited to read the series of the Buckhorn brothers after seeing what great reviews it got and since I liked one of Foster's other books I bought the bundle.The first story in the series is about Sawyer, the oldest brother.  He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.The second story is about Morgan, the second brother.  He's the hunky Sheriff.  In his story he fights the urges to become involved with Misty, Honey's sister.  His story was much better to me than Sawyers.  I was more interested in it and Morgan didn't switch as much in personality.  However, he did mess with Misty's car when she wanted to leave and I didn't really like that he did that.  Seemed juvenile.  His scowling got old after a while, but that was just his personality.  He acted tough, but he was a big softy.  Overall it was a decent story.Gabe's story is third, but he's the youngest brother.  He's the sexy, layback, fun loving brother.  His story was great.  He meets Elizabeth who is the complete opposite of Gabe.  She's prissy, a bookworm, inexperienced, and nave.  Gabe and her clash during the book, but also have a big attraction to one another.  Gabe takes it upon himself to show Elizabeth how to have some fun in life.  This story was a little different than the other two since Elizabeth is different from Honey and Misty.  It was a fun, sexy story that showed how opposites attract.Jordan, the third brother, was the last story.  He's the sexy, calm, vet.  His story was slightly different from the rest.  He meets Georgia, who is a dancer at a bar, divorced, takes care of her mother, and had two children.  Sparks fly right away between them.  Despite Jordan not liking Georgia being a dancer, he never tried to force her to quit and accepted her for who she was and what she had to do to take care of her kids.  I was worried his story was going to be short and he was a great guy so I was glad his story turned out to be complete.  His book was probably my second favorite after Gabe's.Casey, Sawyer son, was also more involved in this story and there's one he's in called Enticing.Overall the series started out a little rocky, but ended up great.  All four brothers have great qualities about them and some flaws.  At times in any of the stories things became predictable.  Also it seemed like every brother fell instantly in love with the woman in their story.  There wasn't a lot of leading up to them realizing they had feelings, it happened right away every time.  But in the end, you can't help but fall in love with each of them.","01 26, 2011",A1DX8P31MBC2PE,JJ,"Started rocky, ended great",1296000000

744,B000SWV6HG,"[1, 1]",4,"This romance book bundles the stories of heroes Sawyer, Morgan, Gabe and Jordan, 4 brothers who live together in their childhood home. Sawyer is the doctor, Morgan is the sheriff, Gabe is the laid back handyman and Jordan is the vet. Each man is in some way the pillar of their small town community, and other than being womanizers (in a nice and respectful way), they are all perfect. For that I gave a 1 star deduction. One decent, halo-over-his-head glowing, handsome, tall, muscular, sexy, honest, single, well-endowed, straight brother is amazing, two is shocking, three is a stretch, and four is defying the laws of possibility.Other than that each story was funny, sweet, and thoroughly enjoyable.Sawyer is a divorced, single father of a teenage son who runs his medical practice from his home and does housecalls. He meets Honey when she loses control of her car and crashes into his fence. Turns out she's suffering from pneumonia but is running from someone who's out to get her. Sawyer shelters her and takes care of her and in the course of that they fall in love.Morgan is single, large and a temper to match. At least he only pretends to have a temper. His bark is worse than his bite, but everyone is so afraid of him that his scowl is enough to keep miscreants out of his town and everyone else on their best behavior. Misty, Honey's sister, enters the picture when she shows up to help Honey prepare for the wedding. Morgan takes an instant dislike to her, a dislike which is only amplified by his attraction to her. He thinks she's too seductive and flirtatious and a walking billboard for trouble. What's more, Misty is broke, unemployed, and pregnant. Wrongly accused of stealing and had arrested and charged by her boss, then abandoned by her boyfriend when she announced her pregnancy. After learning of her situation, Morgan does a 180 on his opinion of her and works to clear her name.Gabe is the town's handyman extraordinaire. He meets Lizzy, a redhead he doesn't find particularly attractive at first, when she comes to interview him for a paper she's writing on people who have performed heroic acts. Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother, but she has serious self-confidence issues. This is a true story of opposites attract. Gabe is as laid back as can be, who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself. He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility. Lizzy is as uptight as one can get, freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun, and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.Jordan is the vet with the golden voice. Georgia is a single mother of two who works as a dancer/waitress to provide for her children and ailing mother. Burnt badly by her ex-husband, she doesn't trust men and doesn't know what to make of 4 men who seem to spend their lives bending over backwards to help others. Especially Jordan, who is great with her children and who has her mother eating out of his hand. Of all the books, this one is the funniest. Jordan's reaction to seeing Georgia dance in a skimpy outfit was priceless. However, of all the books, this one focuses too much on the other secondary characters. Between the romance brewing between Georgia's mother and Misty & Honey's father, and Sawyer's son, I felt a bit shortchanged on the main characters love story.What I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable. So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male, testosterone laden, treat the women like doormats heroes, it's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive. All the women had spunk which is something I also like. They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.Likable characters and cute stories.

Esme is desperately trying to escape her abusie father and marriage to an old and rather sinister man. She throws herself at St John to escape. The plot follows their romance. I found this well written but it failed to make magic for me. Perhaps this was partly because St John was not so likeable in the first book which I read quite recently and therefore could not make the switch to like him. Perhaps it was Esme who just kept throwing herself at him and despite several attempts to get close which failed, still did not really appear to be looking at alternatives seriously to escape what awaited her where she to return home. I cannot say this is bad, the 3 rating is based solely on my gut reaction and the lack of chemistry I felt.

Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war, he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation (plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he'll be an Earl due to an inheritance). So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father, he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children. They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness (Yea, I wasnt buying that). During the next few weeks, St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home. I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away (but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero's protest, at some point you need to get some back bone. Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father. And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste. I skimmed alot so I cannot in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset.

After leaving with the emerald necklace the Duchess gave him, he had joined the army and served with distinction.  After he leaves the army, he must live one year scandal free if he wants a reward offered to him by the Prince Regent.Esme Danville lives with her abusive father who wants to marry her off to a man his age, if not older and just as abusive. Seeing no way out, she decides to become someone's mistress and thus get the marriage called off.  After seeing St. John breaking up with his mistress without laying a hand on her, she decides he is the one she wants.  After hearing her outlandish and most unladylike proposal, he refuses and ends up taking her to his brother's house, a place he is not welcome.  They do agree that they may stay under certain conditions.  The duchess tries to introduce her to eligible men without success.  Esme only has eyes for St. John who is trying to live down his infamous and deal with an addiction to laudanum he uses to deal with wartime memories.  It is hard to ignore Esme and his resolve slowly starts to crumble.After their inevitable return to London, Esme has to endure abuse from her father and despairs of not seeing St. John again.  He does get the reward and faces one challenge after another to  rescue her and get their happily ever after.Because I always wanted to know what happened to him after the end of the first book, I went ahead and bought this one.I think it is good and it kept my attention, something not all Regencies do.  I do recommend it to others who read the first book not only because of  St. John, but also shows how the people in the first book have prospered.  I do suggest they read the books in order as events in the first book are mentioned more than once.","06 14, 2014",A2Z0JW8EQ2EBIZ,Mary Kay McConnell,An Unladylike Offer,1402704000

771,B000U0NSV8,"[2, 2]",4,"My Favorite of the series.  It is the story of Esme Canville and St John Radwell.  St John was the villain in the first book of the series, The Inconvenient Duchess.  In the years since the last novel, St John has transformed himself and is in the process of making himself into a respectable person.  Esme, however, is looking for the villain.  In order to avoid the arranged marriage her father has planned for her, Esme seeks St john to compromise her.  St John, however, delivers her to his brother (with whom he continues to have a strained relationship).  As could be expected, however, Esme and St John become involved in a relationship.I enjoyed this book because of the character of St john.  I really disliked him in the first book and almost stopped reading the book because of him.  However, he has completely redeemed himself and I was deeply interested in how he has remade himself but still has to deal with his past.

Caleb McCurdy has just been released from a five year stint in a Yuma prison. He'd taken the fall for his outlaw brothers who'd tried to rob the bank and left him holding the horses. He'd paid for his participation, but his soul is tormented by the deeds of his brothers at the Shafton Ranch. Caleb owed a debt to the widow Shafton for the killing of her husband, something he had tried to stop. Laura Shafton remembers that evil day five years before in her nightmares. She'd lost her husband but she had her son, Robbie; the unborn child she'd been carrying. She's wary of strangers, so when Caleb knocks on her door to offer work for food, she greets him with a shotgun. While Caleb is mending her gate, Robbie seems to disappear, only to be found hiding in a tree. On his way down the boy falls breaking his arm, and Caleb helps Laura set the break and splint it. This builds a certain amount of wary trust in Laura and she allows Caleb to stay in her tool shed and continue to work for food. Caleb fears that at any time Laura's going to recognize him as the 17 year old who had accompanied those evil men, but he's matured a lot since then and his body has grown strong. Laura too is no longer the teenage bride; she's now a strong independent woman. Their attraction is something that Caleb fights; for he knows that should Laura ever find out who his is she'll never forgive him.I really liked the plot for this story. The characters are very well developed and easy to like. Though both Laura and Caleb are in their early 20's in this book, they've both lived a life time in experiences. Caleb has always been a good man, but he'd been misguided by his need for family, and so he'd stuck with his brothers. Laura is incredibly strong and resilient, almost over the top so. She'll survive anything in order to protect and care for her son.

When a person is forced to grow up faster, than they should for their age and face reality that is exactly what Laura and Caleb did. Caleb was an okay hero. What I disliked about him was that had been with whores. That is just disgusting on so many levels. I get that in romance novels guys aren't suppose to be virgins and women have to be virgins or have been with a least one man, but sleeping with whores takes it to another level. What I did like abut him is that protected Laura and her son, Robbie. Would I recommend his book to anyone? No. Would I read it again? No. It is an okay book to read if you 're bored. I would recommend that anyone who wants to read it should get loaned from a friend or something before buying it. Or else you will be like me who bought and did not like.

I didn't like the idea of the hero deceiving the heroine but he grew on me and so did this story.5 years ago, Caleb and his half brothers pass the Shafton farm house and ask for a meal. Laura Shafton's naive husband welcomes the strangers with open arms and soon the unthinkable happens when one the brothers attempts to rape the pregnant Laura her. Caleb tries to stop his brother but Laura's trauma over the attempted attack and the murder of her husband has her implementing all of the brothers in the crimes including Caleb. The 3 brothers leave and Laura is left scarred, traumatized and a widow with a baby on the way.Fast forward 5 years later. After being released from prison (being the caught scapegoat while his brothers get away), Caleb still remembers the pretty Laura Shafton and what happened at that ranch. He passes by wondering if she's okay and what happened to her. When he gets there he finds Laura and her 4 year old son and seeing her scarred face and haunted eyes brings back the memories. To absolve himself for even being there, he offers to help her around her ranch. She cautiously takes the stranger's offer and soon finds herself befriending the mysterious and rugged Caleb while her son falls in love with having a male figure around.I was really surprised to find myself actually liking this story. Laura is such a strong heroine. You'll cry for all she's lost in family, raising her son alone and losing her confidence in showing her face in town embarrassed by her scarred face. How she survived her ordeal and kept on moving makes her a heroine to love. Caleb is a hero you sympathize with. As a half breed (American/Native American), you feel for him wanting to be around his brothers and accepted but realizing how evil they are and trying to fully break free from their holds even when they're not around.I enjoyed Caleb and Laura separated and definitely together and her son is adorable and his relationship with Caleb and Caleb's ""fatherly"" patience with him made me like Caleb even more.Overall: I'd definitely pick this one up if I were you.

Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blond bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.Across the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.Lucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to dye her hair. Blond was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.Today Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.What started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.Though I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.What really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.Unfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me.Strange Bedpersons- 3 StarsOriginally published in 1994, there's little about this quirky romance about the ladder-climbing yuppie Republican lawyer Nick and the hippie, commune-raised, militant-feminist liberal Tess that doesn't feel almost painfully dated. That being said, Crusie pens a fast-paced plot that delves more deeply than I'd anticipated into the potential disaster of a relationship between two people who love each other, but who are so different they will never see eye to eye.Nick, despite his career-loving little heart, is a fun character who is actually pretty forgiving and able to compromise, though he does have a rather vanilla predilection for sex in bed. He's pretty darn forgiving of some pretty radical behavior and recognizes before Tess does that some compromise is in order, yet he still manages to mess up a little as he presses his own sense of fashion off onto the bohemian Tess and tries to wear down some of her rougher edges before he realizes that he's got to decide to accept her as is or lose her. I found Tess harder to like, though I did respect her commitment to her values. Still, her uncompromising attitude and selfish judgments of those who don't share her militant views were off-putting through most of the book.Strange Bedpersons started abruptly, too abruptly, with Nick banging on Tess' door and Tess closing it in his face, the two of them obviously already sharing a history. It took a little while to get the story on their history, so the opening of the book seemed jarring and left me feeling like I missed something. It made it hard to get into and I had to struggle a bit to 'catch up.' That did subside a bit as the story progressed, though the other issues - the dated feeling and my issues with Tess - didn't. Still, I can't argue Crusie's ability to nail witty, fast-moving dialogue and touch on human truisms with humor and intelligence. I just wish that prior to republication, this story had gone through a bit of a brush up to make it more socially and culturally timely and not quite so anachronistic to contemporary romance.What the Lady Wants- 4 StarsMitchell Peatwick Kincaid is a stockbroker, but a fondness for Sam Spade and a mild feeling of discontent with his job convinced him to get a private investigator license, and about a year ago, a bet with his boss and some friends - and a lot of alcohol - goaded him into leaving his prosperous career with his prestigious firm, putting the stuff from his monied life into storage, and taking on private detecting as a career under the name Mitchell Peatwick. And if he can get his private investigation firm into the black in a year, he'll win that $10,000 bet.Twelve months of private investigating, however, taught Mitch two things: everybody lies, and real life private investigation work doesn't resemble anything remotely similar to Sam Spade's life. Until SHE walked in.SHE is Mae Belle Sullivan and she's looking for a PI who isn't all that bright so she can lie to him.

Answers that will save Mae from financial ruin and explain what her reprehensible old fart of a relative was doing with all the art and keepsakes that have been disappearing from his house for the past few months. An overheard conversation pointed her in the direction of her uncle's journal, but it's been missing since he died and Mae's starting to get frantic to find it. So she lies. And she uses her feminine wiles. And she pays Mitch Peatwick just about everything in her bank account to investigate the murder of her uncle. Who was in his seventies, had a heart condition and a twenty-five year old mistress, and died in her bed. Mae's fairly certain it wasn't murder.Mitch knows he's being lied to by the delicious-looking Mae Belle, but her retainer pushes him into the black and secures his bet...and anything is better than trailing cheating spouses, so he takes her case. There are just a couple of problems for them both. Mitch isn't anywhere near as slow as Mae had hoped, and as more and more clues start to pile up, her uncle's death starts to look more and more like an actual murder - even to Mae.With a quirky cast of primary and secondary characters and a twisting, rollicking plot that includes suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy, What the Lady Wants delivers a lot of charm and a few good hours of light entertainment. Originally published in 1995, the story is a little worn around the edges and has a bit of a dated patina to it, but not so much that it detracts from the story as in some of Crusie's books. It's more like a faint scent on the air than a bat upside the head. Noticeable, but not painful.Mitch is a fun character, and quicker than he looks. Which is probably a good thing. I'm dating myself here, but he reminded me a lot of Magnum PI or Rick Simon from Simon & Simon - a bit cynical about life, a bit sloppy on the outside but sharp and thorough when he needed to be. Mae was endearing. Intelligent and kind, with a streak of independence a mile wide and a determination that is formidable. She's a bit stubborn when she needs to be, but not so cold as to be unappealing as a person. She cares about the people she loves and takes on the responsibility of caring for them, as needed. Together they made a good couple, and their banter was one of the high points of the book.Crusie excels at quickly paced plots with quirky characters and a lot of witty, intelligent, and sarcastic banter. It's what keeps me coming back to her when I want or need some brain candy. I'd love to see this story get a bit of a modernized polish to clear away the dated patina, but even as it stands, I liked it quite a bit.Charlie All Night- 3.5 StarsWhen you're the go-to girl at the radio station and you're producing the number one drive time show in the area, you've got a lot of responsibility and your future is looking bright. When the talent of that show dumps you, then two months later fires you from the show, you're bright future starts to look more like flames from a crash and burn. Allie McGuffey is feeling the heat from those flames after her radio personality ex-boyfriend Mark dumps her as producer and the station puts her on a new overnight time slot. Pushed from drive time to overnight is humiliating. Pushed there by her ex-boyfriend with his supercilious attitude and delusions of competency is even worse.Putting on a good face just leads to another crisis as a mad dash to the nearest bar/restaurant with her ex hot on her heels forces Allie into uncharted waters. She picks up the first non-suit wearing male she can find and desperately tries to act like she's perfectly okay while her insides are still quaking. Though the rugged man she clings to is obviously surprised by her blatant come on, he doesn't sell her out, which makes him a hero in Allie's book.Charlie Tenniel is a bit of a bounce around. He doesn't stay in one place too long, doesn't limit himself to doing one thing for his life, either. His wanderlust is a constant disappointment for his socially formidable father. His brother, radio personality Ten Tenniel, was more the man his father wanted him to be, but look where that got him - a drug habit and escape from prosecution courtesy of their father's connections. Charlie wasn't going to go out like that. He was, however, going to take the job his father wanted him to take as a favor to the station owner, an old family friend. An anonymous tip claims knowledge of a drug ring opperating from the station and Charlie's been conscripted to chase down the responsible party. He just wants to fly under the radar for the six weeks or so he plans to stay in town, so having Allie pressed up against him is just fine, but when he realizes she's his new producer and intends to make him a star, he's just as adamant that she doesn't.His position would probably be a lot stronger if he could just stay out of her bed.While the premise of Charlie All Night is a bit of a stretch and the actions of Allie and Charlie seem more than a little irresponsible both sexually and professionally, I can't argue that the story itself is light, fun entertainment with plenty of endearing moments. I enjoyed the banter and romantic development between Allie and Charlie. Crusie does banter and endearing really well and it's definitely in evidence here. There's not much to the plot, though, and with an original publication date of 1996, there's a dated feel to both the technology and equipment described in the station and a definite pre-Monica Lewinsky air of sexual permissiveness in the work place that didn't translate well for me.So long as you don't take the book too seriously, or expect much in the way of depth of plot or character, there's still a lot of entertainment to be had from the story of Charlie and Allie, two people who won't be poster children for sexual harassment litigation any time soon, but who still managed to make me chuckle.Originally reviewed by title for One Good Book Deserves Another.","09 5, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Humor But Little 'Contemporary' Romance,1283644800

820,B000UMZMP6,"[2, 2]",4,"This story has several themes I personally really enjoy in erotica or erotic romance: full-figured heroine, military hero, interracial relationship, and an element of coercion. Although the coercion is a small part of the story, and I wouldn't characterize it as hardcore or full-on, it is still there for me to enjoy. Now, I know this idea of coercion doesn't work for everyone, but Abby's seeking to appease Mason with her body was very hot to me.Plus, she really wasn't doing something she didn't want to do. She'd been resisting Mason for weeks, denying him at every turn, and I think this was a convenient reason for her to give in to her attraction to Mason. For his part, he sees this as an opportunity to force her to spend some time with him and to take a chance on him. And how she resisted this man for a month, I just do not know. A military alpha with that commanding presence, muscular body, beautiful brown skin, sexy bedroom eyes, and a total good guy all the way around-- What was the girl thinking?Abby does have her reasons for resisting him, and as she and Mason spend the weekend together, stronger feelings other than lust develop. This story isn't long; it's actually around 58 pages. There is lots of sex, but it's done the way I love sex to be done: super hot, well-written, with the sexy edge of an in-charge man, and with a very sweet emotional connection between h/H. While there is no 'I love you' moment, I definitely felt HEA was in store for this couple. I thought it was a hot read with one very yummy hero who was tired of taking 'No' for an answer. There's no way Abby's getting away from him now.","09 1, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S. Richards,Trusting Mason,1314835200

They had met at a rodeo where Rafe was riding a huge bull and dry humped in a barn later.  Cathy was letting down her hair by going to the rodeo instead of sipping champagne at the country club before heading back to Boston to take  her place as an  attorney  in family tradition and never regretted their love making until she went home and he never called,  Then one day he was on her door step and her heart bounded in her chest as she invited him in for a drink where he proposed and she accepted.  It had been four years ago and most of last year they rarely saw each other, he treated her like fragile porcelin instead of a wife; it was moneey from her trust fund that saved the ranch and her salary that kept them in the black yet her name was not on the deed!The moment Rafe sat atop the bull and glanced at the pretty woman with clothes so new they screamed designer he was hooked and when she smiled he was a goner!  Seven seconds later he was thrown but he did not care because he had to meet this woman!  Looking back, the sex was amazing but when she got hired by the county she stayed away longer and longer and he knew she wanted him to do some thing but for the life of him he did not know what! Standing there watching her go he choked on the lump in his throat knowing she took his heart with her.Dee S. Knight pens one terrific read that will make you shed tears, squirm, and be glued to your seat at the same time as you rapidly read!

Will these two who obviously love each other find a way to salvage their marriage and start to trust in one another?Second Wind is a very good story.  Communication and trust is the key to a solid relationship.  Rafe and Cathy had neither of these and to add to their problems, their jobs didn't leave them with much one on one time.  Cathy did well by Rafe, and honestly she gave a whole lot more than she got from him.  Rafe wasn't a bad person he just wasn't on Cathy's level, but opposites do attract and that was definitely demonstrated here.  What they lacked in other aspects of their marriage they compensated with the strong passion they had for each other.  They were hot together but need to work on life outside the bedroom.

I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong. Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck. I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry.

It's his willingness, even when he's not sure of it, to step out of his comfort space that I liked. There's a very touching moment when he struggles with what he wants from Jeff. I loved that scene, even though it broke my heart.Jeff is hard to understand. He's got a lot going on and a lot to hide. But it's believable. He can't lose his daughter, but he can't seem to let go of Ryan. That sort of conundrum is a good one to have in some ways. Ryan's a hunky catch. Anna, Jeff's daughter, adds a cute and heartwarming touch. She's smitten with Ryan and totally in favor of her daddy being happy. If only all people could be that understanding...If you want a story that's hot and has a sizzling scene in a Camaro (my vehicular weapon of choice), then you need to read Custom Ride.

Lucia is a commoner who is working as a serving maid at a local tavern. Lucia has been trying to help a dragon (Sir Reynor) who is hurtand ill, but her skills are not up to the job. She finally goes to the castle to get help from a healer and is immediately involvedwith the dragon's knight Sir Marcus and his partner Sir Kaden, Reynor's mate.Lucia is a from the country of Helios, raised by the Jinn, she does not have a commoner background, she has a limited healing ability and is not afraid of dragons. Sir Marcus is totally captivated by her and his partner is also attracted in spite of his feelingsof guilt about Reynor's injury. The three can become a family, if Reynor can be healed and is able to fly again. Learning about Lucia's background and why she doesn't act the part of a serving maid becomes part of her attraction to the two knights.This story was listed as number 4.5 in the series and was only $2.66.

No matter, she was just determined to save her dying friend, the dragon Reynor, and to do that she must engage the help of his Knight, Sir Kaden, or his love, the dragoness Linea.A waitress in a simple pub, Lucia certainly never expected to return to the tavern with two dragons, two Knights, and the Queen of Draconia herself in tow!  But it is just this troupe of heroes that arrive in time to help Reynor, for it is not just his body that is withering, but his spirit as well.It soon becomes clear to Knights Kaden and Marcus that Lucia is their mate, fated to complete the union between dragons and knights and round out their family.  But Lucia isn't from Draconia, and while she has heard rumor of the strange custom in which two Dragon Knights must marry one woman, she is uncertain she can go through with it...If you have read many of my reviews, it is no secret to you that I am a huge fan of author Bianca D'Arc, and most especially her Dragon Knights stories.  You can imagine my pleasure that she continues to imagine new stories for this fascinating series, and that she seems to have no trouble finding ways to keep the stories fresh and exciting, as proven once more with the newest edition in the saga, Wings of Change.With this new story, we enjoy a return to the m&eacute;nage theme that began the series.  This scenario guarantees some built-in angst for the story as Lucia tries to come to terms with the idea of mating with two men, a situation beyond her experience or the societal norms of her own country.  But Kaden and Marcus are more than up to the task of convincing her that their love is true and right, with a little help from Marcus' dragoness, the Lady Linea.Of course, the relationship between these three isn't the sole focus of D'arc's book - she fleshes it out nicely with some long-hidden secrets about Lucia, some of which she herself is hiding, and a few of which have been long hidden from her.  As we learn Lucia's secrets, we see that she may very well be a most important figure in the future of the war between Draconia and Sskithdron.The author introduces us to yet another most intriguing new species, something I believe I'm becoming rather spoiled on!  As a long-time lover of Fantasy stories, my excitement with the introduction of each new creature builds more and more, expanding not only the horizons within this world, but my interest as well.Wings of Change is the fifth story in the Dragon Knights series, and will be released in print in the future anthology, I Dream of Dragons I.  While this book can be read as a standalone without leaving the reader confused, the story will be best enjoyed if you read the entire series in order.

She wakes up in a motel room the next day with a concussion.  Mac is with her.  He was recently hired to work with her on the horse farm.  Together they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about it.  Maris has no memory of what she was doing before she was injured.  Maris realizes she is attracted to Mac.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was about half the length of a typical romance novel.  It was a ""falling in lust"" story.  There was no time for any relationship development.  It was shallow.  I wanted more intrique, unique characters, and more interesting plot and dialogue.  But if you loved the series, you might like this out of curiosity.After the mystery and danger is over, a chunk of time is spent with Maris' family in Wyoming.  There is the cute little toddler, all the hunky men, their wives and children.  Everyone is loving and protective.  It was a pleasant time.OTHER BOOKS:There are five Mackenzie books.  The first three were much better than books 4 and 5.  This is book 4.  For a list of my reviews of all five books, see my 5 star review of Burn posted 7-11-09.CAUTION SPOILER:I didn't understand the scene in which Maris was hit in the head (which was told and not shown).  Apparently the bad guy was starting to inject the horse when Maris arrived.  He hits her in the head causing a concussion, but she is able to get on the horse and ride away.  Can one be concussed and still mount and ride?  Why couldn't the bad guy finish the injection as she was mounting?  I wanted more details and showing, not telling.DATA:Kindle count story length: 1462.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 1, about a page long.

Certainly not all gay men, or even all ""bottoms.""  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical?

The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature.

He's sizing up the local werewolf pack, introducing himself so he can scope out the feasibility of moving here. What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack.

The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.I heartily recommend it, and especially recommend ""Without Reservations"" and ""With Caution"" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations).

It made for a good attention grabber.  Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.Dev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.When Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.

The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.It is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.It was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.","11 9, 2012",A3MT311233OHMQ,"Sophia Rose ""Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...",Quick Fun Read That Jumps Right in With the Plot and Romance,1352419200

The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden.

Putting a book as a freebie draws in those with no interest in the genre.All that said, the demon tale is one I would choose to read from a favorite author, as I am a fan of horror and supernatural fiction, so I reserve the right to be a tad critical. The set up of the story (the pre-prologue, if you like) was great. It tells the history of the demons, how they came to be. It was well written, interesting & gave me hope that it would be a great book.  As another reviewer stated though, the actual prologue was rather cliche-ridden with Gage and his ""lethal charm"" and Jordan resisting at every turn until she melted into his kisses. But I pushed on....As we know from the pre-prologue, Shadow Demons roam the earth. They are evil, they feed on emotion. Jordan, our heroine, is a vigilante destroyer: cop by day, demon slayer by night, after she witnessed the brutal murder of her partner and lover at the sword of a Shadow Demon.The storyline itself isn't bad, but it does lack development of the characters. Other than Jordan being stubborn and feisty, there's not much else that we learn about her. The twist in the tale isn't shocking - not because I expected it (I didn't at all) but because we didn't get to know enough about any of the other characters to really care, and so when the twist was revealed, it gave me more of a ""oh"" reaction than a ""WOW! I never would have guessed"" shocker.My title calls this repetitive, and it does become so. The same fight scenes replay, but worse - the same sex scene is basically repeated over and over. I think even those readers who love a racy sex scene would be disappointed. By the 3rd replay, I skipped them altogether. Nothing new here.","11 7, 2009",A3JR6D5B9WF5J8,Danielle,Repetitive story line,1257552000

I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you like the fantasy or urban fantasy type novels, I think you might like this one.  Be aware that this book has some rather racy bits in it, so I don't think kids should probably read it.  The only problem with this book for me is that it has no chapter demarcations.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how far along a person is in a book and how close a person is to the end of a chapter when he/she needs to find a stopping place at times.  Give it a shot because it might be just a bit of escapist fun for a while.  Have at it!

The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future, Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper.

The first book I ever read to make a vampire the romantic lead, you kicked off a genre that has exploded and will not be stopped.  Truly groundbreaking, I thank you so much for leading the way and clearing a path for more.If you haven't read these books, DO SO NOW!A human can only become a vampire if they contain a rare blood antigen, and each vampire has one human with the antigen (a chosen) whom they feel drawn to protect.  A government agency, DPI (department of paranormal investigations), is out to capture and make lab rats out of every vampire possible and they're not above using The Chosen to do it.  And if they can't capture, they don't hesitate to kill.With this series, you get a complete story of two characters in each book, but we still get to reacquaint ourselves with some of our favorites along the way.Having read these books as a teenager, I was hesitant to reread them as an adult.  So many books that I loved back then fail to resonate with me now.  Wings in the night did not disappoint and I was enthralled once again.I truly believe that without this series, we would have no Twilight, no Midnight Breed, and no Blackdagger Brotherhood.  I'm not saying Wings In The Night inspired those books, I'm saying Wings In The Night created the genre and made it popular.","04 12, 2014",A1LWBT4OIUF49X,avidreader,"These books were the start of my obsession with ""good"" vampires.",1397260800

The other thing, I'm not sure how to put into words, but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example, Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this.

972,B000XZKZKM,"[3, 3]",5,"Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

Vowing at the tender age of five to marry him, she has had to live with the ridicule of that one statement until she has hardened her heart against Rafe.  When she finds out that her father has given his permission and signed a marriage contract between she and Rafe, Emma is hurt and angry.  She knows that deep down a man life Rafe could never love a woman like her so she sets out to negotiate her own marriage terms.Rafe Sinclair can't believe his grandfather put a stipulation to his inheritance.  If he doesn't marry by his birthday, the ranch on which he lives will no longer be his.  Having no choice but to find a wife, Rafe doesn't look forward to the politics that go along with wife hunting.  However, his problem is solved when Emma Radcliff's father and he agree on his marrying Emma.  Now if he can just get Emma to agree, his inheritance will be safe and Rafe will have a wife.Emma and Rafe have to learn to be a team.  Each is cantankerous in their own way, Emma more so in my opinion than Rafe.  She was so angry at times that even I winced at her displeasure.  I thought Rafe was loyal and hero worthy.  He was patient and kind to Emma and I wished more than once that she was a bit softer for this sexy virile man.  Beth Williamson came through for me with Emma's characterization because by the time I read the last word and closed Branded, I knew without a doubt that Emma was meant for Rafe and vice versa.Beth Williamson never fails to deliver a book that will keep me entertained and on the edge of my seat.  Her storyline of Branded was unique and I loved how it ended.  Nobody writes western historical romances like Beth Williamson and I am proud to be one of her biggest fans.","02 8, 2008",A1PW5SQLR0Z6IH,"Natalie S ""ns65""",Joyfully Reviewed!,1202428800

He loved her but did not know it, did not even know what love was...literally had no idea, and she loved him even when she did not want to. She left for about 5 months before he found her again. She was 8 months or so pregnant and the baby was 4 months old when he caught up to them. The heroine takes things for granted and should have talked to the hero when his assistant told her they were sleeping together, but she had insecurities that all pregnant women have and thought he wanted someone else. They were faithful during their time apart, which is always a plus to me. My favorite part is when she told him about how she had been proposed to before and that the waiter was going to propose tonight (to his own g/f, but she leaves that out to the hero) and he gets up and leaves, doesn't say anything, and comes back 30 minutes later with a ring.

There were some misunderstandings, that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone, and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story, because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin, a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart, as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture.

This time it's Ross Benson's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.Ross Benson is wealthy, titled, and thoroughly enjoys the London social scene and all that it entails.  He's earned a reputation among the women and has been very careful to avoid interacting with marriage minded young women and innocents.  The last thing he intends to happen is to seduce the sister of his best friend Timothy.Cassandra Rollins far prefers life in the country.  She detests crowds, couldn't care less about fashions, and has no interest in any of the things that most women covet.  She's a true bluestocking and thrives on furthering her knowledge of the world about her through her love of books.  The only trait that she shares with the shallow society women is her adoration of Ross.Cassandra's sleep is interrupted by the return of her brother and Ross's voices singing bawdy songs that certainly weren't meant for a lady to hear.  The men are obviously inebriated but she doesn't grow concerned until the singing stops and she hears a thud and a low curse.  When she opens the door to check on them, Timothy is passed out in a sitting position outside his own bedroom with Ross trying unsuccessfully to rouse him.  They manage to get Timothy to his bed and then Ross admits that he can't remember which guest room is his.  Cassandra makes the offer to escort him to his room so that he doesn't end up climbing into bed with her very formidable aunt.  From a maidenly point of view, that offer of assistance may turn out to be a mistake.  As she's getting ready to leave him to ready himself for bed, Ross requests that she kiss him good night and she finds that she can't deny him the request and soon doesn't want to deny him or the pleasures that they'll both find in his bed.  Will they come to regret the results of their reckless moment?IN A RECKLESS MOMENT is the third book in Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This storyline is full of all the loveable characters, passion and suspense that I've come to eagerly anticipate about this series.  I adored Cassandra because she is so different from society ladies.  She's extremely intelligent and honest, not to mention beautiful.  With the combination of those traits she manages to snare Ross's affection and keep him firmly enthralled with her.  Ross has been living the `privileged' lifestyle for so long he doesn't even see how self-indulgent and jaded it is until after he marries Cassandra. There's just a little issue from his past poses a threat and I have to admit, I was fascinated by that twist to the storyline.While I do personally recommend reading all the books in this series - just because I've honestly loved them - they can easily be read as stand alone stories and doing so won't detract from your enjoyment of them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","06 11, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

1020,B000ZKNRPK,"[0, 0]",3,"Emma Wildes short novella about an innocent aristocrat and a rake works very well in places and other times its a tad flat.The opening scenes of this novel are well written because it gives the reader a good background of the characters and they have a history which makes this novel believable.  Cassandra has always had a big crush on her brother's best friend nobleman Ross Benson.  Cassandra is young only nineteen and she is a bluestocking enjoying country pursuits much more than London gaiety.Ross and his friend are drunk and when Cassandra helps him to his room he engages in some romantic kisses that end up with the two in bed.  Ross does the honorable deed of course and offers for her and Cassandra agrees to the wedding.  She is astute enough to realize she could be pregnant.What follows mostly in this short story is their adjustment to married life.  Ross simply loves London and his wife does not.  Ross genuinely likes Cassandra but his feelings are not fully engaged until later.  I liked Ross because he did not take himself too seriously and he had a teasing but kind sense of humor.I cannot say the same about Cassandra who was tart, somewhat priggish (surprising for a woman whose first intimacies are outside marriage) and she just did not respond well to Ross's sweet teasing and innuendo.  He was a dynamic interesting person while Cassandra comes off as humorless and interested more in her books than her surroundings.  She never was as charismatic as her lead which leaves this book with a three star rating.","09 26, 2011",A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,Melissa,Liked the hero more than the heroine,1316995200
1021,B000ZKNRPK,"[1, 1]",5,"Ross Benson, Viscount Winterton, is recently returned from Africa.  He is a jaded rake of a man, and the object of many women's fantasies.  He and Timothy Rollins are arriving back at Ivydale Manor, drunk, when they wake young Cassandra, Timothy's sister, who helps both men to bed.  When she ends up in bed with Ross, her lifetime crush, it will have repercussions none of them counted on.Ross is handsome, sought after and has never had an inclination toward innocent young women.  For some unfathomable reason, Cassandra tempts him like no woman has before.  When he seduces her on a night of drunken stupor, he has no choice but to marry the alluring Cassandra.In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.  I thoroughly enjoyed Emma Wildes' In a Reckless Moment and I intend to purchase all of the previous titles.Scarletreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","05 16, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,In a Reckless Moment,1210896000

We meet a beautiful young woman that is saved by a caring older man via a platonic marriage. The opening scene is this h enjoying a dip in a river while unbeknownst to her, Devon, our H, is watching her lustfully from the trees.  The H is the son of her husband.  He was raised by his aunts after his mother died and the Father felt  unprepared to raise him by himself. Devon is later kidnapped and raised by a band of lawless men.  Devon is tough, dominant and ...yes...gorgeous .....and huge...in every way.....hence.....the cannon references.  As the story opens, Devon is on his way to see the Father he does not remember because he has been sent a message that the old man is dying.Devon,totally hot.  I dug his alpha ways and the sex scenes in which he is totally dom like.  I did feel sorry for the secondary male in the story, the doctor. There are some threesome scenes and the doc is more or less a foil to show how dom-like Devon is to the whole dynamic.I must admit, I read this book several weeks ago and cannot remember the heroine's name. Forgive me.  This is a long book. I paid a dollar for it and it is worth it.  The author attempts to make this more than just erotica by giving us a bigger story in which we follow the Hero on his trail ride to hunt and kill some fathomless bad guys.  This part I skimmed.  But  this is a sexy, erotic read if this is what you want.  Do not expect a deep introspective or thought provoking read.

Why make Lou Anne part of the master plan?  Why would a grown man take his grown date back to the HS cafeteria for a pizza date?  I know that the author tried to throw in some story about when they were teenagers and he took her to the cafeteria, but it seemed like an afterthought.  That little tidbit should have been included in all the other information in the beginning of the story.  I didn't find the prom thing romantic or fitting to the story at all.

It is magnificent and captivating, and it's apparent from the first chapter that Edgar Rice Burroughs is a genius. This is a wonderful story filled with his spectacular thoughts and imagination. Original, epic, and enthralling, I was unable to put it down and am chomping at the bit to read the next four books in the collection. A true master of the sci/fi adventure genre on par with Vance and Wells......""The Gods of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The hectic, chaotic, frenetic, pace continues as John Carter, his son Carthoris, and Tars Tarkas take on the Issus and the ""the blacks"" to rescue Dejah Thoris (Princess of Helium). Massive battles and unrelenting treachery and deceit continues to fuel the fusilade of destruction on the enemy air fleets. Pulp sci/fi adventure at its best makes this one of the most entertaining stories of all time from the pen of a master storyteller......""The Warlord of Mars"" saga and action continues unabated in the third book in the Barsoom Series and it's fantastic! Almost constant conflict confronts John Carter, Prince of Helium, as he fights for the release of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The budding love between their son Carthoris and Thuvia of Ptarth brings joy to both houses. Edge of your seat battles against the Lord of the Thenes, Matai Shang, and his minion Thurid will keep you awake at nights as the Jed's come together and unite under the Jedakk of Jedakaks, the Warlord of Barsoom!......""Thuvia, Maid of Mars""carries on and expands this epic collection of stories. Book IV of the series shifts the focus away from John Carter to his son Carthoris and Thuvia, the love of his life. Enduring many hardships and death defying battles and contraptions Carthoris rescues Thuvia and receives the blessing from Kulan Tith, her designated husband, to marry her in his stead. Although a bit repetitive with events/confrontations similar to the previous books this is never-the-less a thrilling roller coaster ride that will exhilarate and enthrall you throughout...onward to the V and final book in the collection......""The Chessmen of Mars"" is my least favorite book in ""The Barsoom Series."" I loved the pacing and one of the most original and imaginative creature/humanoid/ creations in all of science fiction ""Ghek the Kaldane from Bantoom."" Kaldane's are unquestionably one of the most unusual, unique, creepy, entertaining yet unsettling, beings ever conjured by an inditer in the sci/fi genre...a simply wonderful and amazing creature!

So why did I download THE ADVENTURES of ""John Carter on Mars"" - THE ORIGINAL FIVE STORIES? I'm not sure. Maybe because I had been reading H. Rider Haggard's ""Allan Quatermain"" series and saw a similarity between the stories about AQ and JC. Both are chock-full of adventure and nonstop action; take place in exotic locations: Africa and Mars; and both are easy to read while I jog on my treadmill. There are probably other reasons, but maybe they're of a subconscious nature.The storyline of ""A Princess of Mars"" (The first book in the series.) has already been mentioned, so I won't say too much more about it. Generally, though, it's a story about creatures who are always at war, the green Martians (ugly, very tall and unemotional) vs the red Martians (attractive, human-like and full of emotion).There is a lot of warring going on on the planet Barsoom/Mars with green Martians against red Martians and greens against other greens and reds battling other reds. Who, then, comes between them all and is captured at one time or another by both sides, wins some of their green and red hearts, is betrayed by green and red, imprisoned here and there, and ultimately...? None other than earth man John Carter, ex-captain in the CSA during the American Civil War, and unwitting traveler to this strange world. There is also a love story sandwiched in between the action and adventure segments.

When a marriage is arranged to a Duke's daughter it looks as if their money troubles are finally behind them.  But, when the Lady in question is found in a compromising position with Michael's brother, he just can't go through with the wedding.  Now he needs a rich heiress.  The only one that looks like they fit the bill is the ""upstart"" American Emma Marks.Emma is attracted to Michael but she thinks he is too rigid for her liking.

The more time she spends with him, and then there is the kiss, the more she thinks they will suit.

He's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates.  His father refused and Dylan's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful.  He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire.  His has very little funds, is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he's staying and his father's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry, Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman.  She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they're all far more interested in her monetary value then her.  Besides, she's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless.  There's only one man who appeals to her, Captain Dylan Blake, but he's a second son and doesn't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father's all-important annual ball.  Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late.  While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan's audacity, Natalia is intrigued.  She's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake.  Once there, Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan's choosing.  The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish.  The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he's never had any trouble charming any woman, Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he's become.  There's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down.  Dylan's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who's too smart to accept any less than all of him.  Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia's story.  Dylan's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much.  Natalia is impossible not to like - she's smart, beautiful and not at all pretentious.  I loved the emotional turmoil both characters experience throughout this storyline and especially enjoyed how Dylan learns about the family secrets his father tried so hard to keep hidden from him.

He foolishly takes on a bet to get Lady Natalia to dance two dances in one evening with him.  He feels that with his charm it will be one way that he can finally get some funds.  He doesn't count on being rebuked by the lady and then charmed by her whole being.Lady Natalia Sinclair is the only child of the Duke of Clayton and therefore has a huge dowry.

Would Natalia's broken trust be too big an obstacle for the two awakened hearts to overcome?***  Tracy Seybold writing as Diana Bold has once again captivated me with her skillful blend of intriguing plots and intelligent characters. My only problem with this story was that I started it too late in the evening and had trouble putting it down - so much so that after much tossing and turning, I to get up and finish it!Bold fashioned Dylan as a very compelling and intriguing man terribly hurt by his inability of having his father demonstrate any loving kindness towards him except in the form of disgust.  After ten years of heroic fighting Dylan sold his commission quickly running through his funds.  Knowing it would infuriate his father Dylan showed up late for a fete and his father cut off him off financially which partly explains his drunken error as to how he was so easily goaded into a wager - a wager which in itself was actually quite innocent.  Just have the very snooty daughter of a duke dance twice in one night with him.  Having caught the lady's eye earlier in the evening Dylan was sure of his charm and utterly shocked when the seeming star struck young woman refused to dance with him.Natalia was a victim of low self-esteem.  At school she'd been the victim of jealousy, and made to think that the only attractive thing about her was her huge dowry.  As a young impressionable girl this peer pressure marked her and wariness of anyone who tried to get close. Having followed Dylan's exploits of heroism during the war, Natalia was infatuated with the hero, but not enough to fall at his feet.  It wasn't until she had a chance to get to know and talk to him that she was able to understand and begin to trust; especially when she realized that he sought  the very same thing as she - someone who really cared.","01 6, 2008",A3B48AN8JID1JK,M.

However, this has not stopped her from dreaming about a war hero who seems to be nothing like the men of society--who only see her large dowry when they look at her. She has built up the reputation as a cold lady who follows her own strict rule of not allowing two dances to the same gentleman at a ball. In reality, she doesn't wish to encourage any man who she knows will not meet with her father's approval. Dylan is the unloved, unwanted second son of an earl.

Only the girl is warm and kind and seems to see through him like no one else ever cared to. He never counted on losing his heart but he may have just wagered more than he bargained to lose.I could totally relate to Natalia--who feared being wanted for something other than herself.

Steve Peek has a unique talent for building believable characters that you can't help but identify with. This story is very complex and has a lot of elements that I had not seen before, and was not at all what I had expected.If you like books that will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire experience, this is the book to choose. I was particularly fascinated with the way his characters reacted to things. The suspense he manages to build through their uncertainty and terror leaves you half afraid to turn the page, but half afraid not to. This is the type of book that could be adapted into a very exciting movie. The author's descriptions are detailed and bring the book to life before your eyes as though you are watching a film. Here is an example of his descriptive writing:""The house looked as if it had never seen a coat of paint. The gray planks warped and strained against the rusty nails, which bled dark-red streaks from years of rain."" Rather than telling the reader everything that is going to happen step by step, Steve Peek allows us to connect the dots and reveals his story through the actions of his characters.There was no extra fluff or poorly utilized space in this novel.By the time you reach the middle of this book, the pages turn furiously.

That meant you only had 70% of the book left in which to get to know them and feel something for them.It took a while, but eventually I did start to care for a couple of the characters. I think the kicker for me though, the turning point in my feelings for the book, revolved solely around the dog. I felt more for that wiry-haired pooch than any of the other characters. That could be because I'm an animal person, but I don't think so. In fact I believe it's got more to do with the characterisation that the dog had that the other characters were lacking.The antagonists were brilliant creations of horrific proportions, but strangely humanesque in some of their actions, protecting their young and mates for example, and so completely alien in other aspects.I didn't really appreciate the dialogue around them and their existence in their world; I think it would have been enough knowing that they came from a hellish world without all the rest of it too.The thing that kept me engaged and enjoying this story was the science/history behind the different worlds. The ley lines and the Indian culture, the standing stones and the magic that was obviously so thoroughly researched by Steve. That part of the story was steeped in so much truth that even though it was completely 'out there' I found myself wanting to believe it too.I didn't much like how things ended, but then I can't say I didn't expect it a little anyway. Steve seemed to enjoy mutilating characters, finding creative ways to dispatch them from the story and well, I guess I came to expect that any characters were potential targets, even those who deserved a second chance at things or ones who were young and innocent.This book is certainly not for the feint-hearted. It starts off slowly enough, but by the end of it you'll be wading through so much blood and guts it all just starts to blur together.This book could do with another pass over by an editor.

1085,B0010ZGPB2,"[1, 1]",5,"From [...]I have never before read a book like Steve Peek's Long Claws.It is a thriller and a horror story. The tale unfolds with so much mystery, sections of the story delivered one chunk at a time, that you're held captive to its pages simply out of a desire to find out why something happened in a previous chapter. It's one of those books that keeps you saying, ""Okay, just one more page and then I'll mow the lawn."" And you keep saying it over and over until you're at the last page, not knowing how you got there so quickly.Mr. Peek tells the story from many perspectives, jumping around from character to character, revealing the bigger picture in stages. Normally, for me, this is a writing style that puts me off; I like to bond with my main character, and I don't like it when the narrative runs off to follow someone else. But with Long Claws, although there is a main character, the other characters that are touched upon are just as unique and interesting. With each turn of the tale, I was surprised to feel a little disappointed that I had to take leave of the character I'd just been following - that's a good thing. It means I was fully invested in each and every one of them, a strong testament to the author's skill.And here is the most amazing part: some of the characters followed are insects, some are werewolves (sort of), some are regular people, and others are people with special powers of awareness. Yes - insects. Steve Peek takes you into the minds and inner workings of a species of insects he's created. And he does it well.This story is epic. The majority of it spans the course of a fifty(ish) year period, but its roots go back tens of thousands of years. Modern mysteries and legends are woven into the fabric of new legends that are the foundation of this story.This isn't a story that begins with a bang. Do not put it down if you are not hooked by the first five pages. You will not be disappointed if you continue the story to its conclusion.","07 13, 2013",A3IT3XAOJKN59B,Matthew Keith,A Must-Read for Horror Fans - A Truly Original Story!,1373673600
1086,B0010ZGPB2,"[1, 1]",4,"I was immediately drawn by the book's cover. It reminds me of those lurid (meant in a good way!) covers on old horror stories which I love and miss with today's generic appearance of most books. The plot summary sealed the deal: I had to read this one!Three different story-lines are intricately woven into a compelling story: a clan of vampire-like beings called longclaws living in a parallel, prehistoric-like world, hunting for fresh blood and hiding from other, even more menacing creatures. An ancient Indian tribe knowing about the dangerous otherworldly beasts and closing the energy lines leading to their world. A teenage runaway boy ending up with his old great-uncle who lives to protect humanity by guarding the portal.Then one longclaw discovers a way to cross the border into paradise: our human world, where they are superior predators among easy prey. A brutal fight for survival begins - on both sides.The author uses different time lines, parallel worlds and different points of view, sometimes retelling a scene as experienced from both humans and longclaws. Where other books get lost in their overwhelming, confusing complexity, that is never the case with longclaws, where all parts converge into a coherent and unique whole.The underlying premise that our folklore especially about vampires and werewolves stems from encounters with creatures from another dimension mark Longclaws as an outstanding work in the 'fangs&claws;' genre. However, this distinctive novel will surely appeal to fans of all types of horror.(I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review)","04 10, 2013",A39K0X3OH4SSZL,misspider,Wow!,1365552000
1087,B0010ZGPB2,"[4, 4]",4,"At first glance, I almost dismissed Longclaws as a seen-it-before monster novel, derivative of that 1980's horror that filled my bookshelves long ago.  I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.  I can only hope that he has a few more tales to dust off and put out there, because I want to see what else lurks in the darkness of his brain.","03 18, 2013",A231LBC8EGPO5L,"OutlawPoet - In a Corrupt Stew ""OutlawPoet""",Mmmm....Monsters....,1363564800

It's one of those novels where there are two themes unfolding in alternating chapters. But they tie in together brilliantly.It starts off with creatures from a distance past. The kind of creatures legends are made out of. But people never take as having an ounce of truth in it. You are introduced to Longclaws a clan of animals that are vicious, bloodthirsty yet protective of their own. But they are not alone in this unforgiving world. The reader is taken on an adventure as the book describes them beautifully where you can imagine in your mind what is being written. Kudos on that alone. The picture has been painted well.Enter the Mason family who has a history and knowledge of the creatures. They are the keepers of the entrance that separates our world from theirs. It is imperative the doors remain close. For the alternative would involve chaos and destruction for both worlds.This book starts off a little slow. However I encourage the reader to keep reading.

Animals begin acting wildly.  The lives of several Peculiar residents are linked together in this suspenseful, science fiction novel.I enjoyed this novel because it was suspenseful in parts, had well developed characters and was very well written.For the most part, the book was suspenseful and a page turner.  I had to get to the next page, chapter and definitely had to find out how it all ended!  However, there were some scenes that I felt were too long or drawn out.  This took away from some of the scenes.  I especially felt this way near the end of the book where I think it was filled with too much description.  I felt it was slower-paced with lots of explanation that was not necessary.  That being said, I want to reiterate that there was good suspense and at no point did I want to stop reading or skip to the end.I felt the book was a bit gory.  I expected a science fiction novel but this was a hybrid - mostly science fiction with a few pages of gore.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and I wouldn't take off any stars, but it's just good for a reader to know.  It's now tagged as ""horror"" as well and I think that tag wasn't there when I purchased the book.I was a little disappointed with Rachel's storyline.  I wanted to know more about her link to the unspeakable crime in the past.  Without giving anything away here, I suppose I expected more resolution on that side story regarding said crime.The characters were great.  I felt connected to all of them and I could empathize with them.  I cared about what happened to them and wanted to see how the story turned out for each and every one of them.  I enjoyed being on an adventure with these characters.  I'd go on another one with them.  I think I would have liked to see Gordon more developed but maybe that was the point - he was supposed to be a bit mysterious.  I enjoyed (for the most part) the character of Rollins.  He was a bit uneven but I liked that.  I liked how the point of view changed.  It wasn't hard to follow and the reader gets to experience the storylines of the different characters.There was a lot of science in the book.  I have no idea if it was accurate or not but there was a lot of scientific description that was way over my head.  Thankfully one of the characters felt the same way :-) so another character regularly  explained the science behind the aliens.  However, it was still a lot for my taste.  All in all, I found the book to be very well written.  Robert Williams is a very talented author and I plan to see what else he has written.","03 8, 2010",A1YTA3TBWBPCPG,blondie,A Peculiar Invasion,1268006400

The story reminded me a bit of a cross between ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but in fact it's neither. In ""Andromeda Strain,"" the action takes place primarily at a remote laboratory where scientists study the alien organism that has infected and killed most of a small town's population. In ""Peculiar, MO,"" the action is in the town itself and centers around the organism's effects on the local people and a biological terrorism military unit that is studying the alien organism and trying to limit its spread. The tension grows steadily as the unit's scientist comes to the terrifying realization that the organism is attempting to invade the earth, not just infect it.The author's scientific explanation of the mechanism by which the alien plasmids (short strands of DNA) could use earth's plants and animals, including humans, to regenerate the alien species and rebuild its group consciousness and memory is quite detailed. I don't remotely have enough science background to know how plausible this is, but it was a fascinating concept that was more credible than the typical aliens-invade-human-bodies stories. I'll give the author a lot of credit for originality.The author builds the story around several characters. The principal characters, including Kelly Ross, Spencer Dale, and the mysterious John Gordon, are likable, well developed three-dimensional characters. There are some bad guys too, and the author kills them off in some very satisfying (i.e., gruesome) ways.As another reviewer noted, the military unit involved in the story was very small and was led by a non-commissioned officer, with privates doing most of the work. This wasn't very realistic, since the government had already dealt with a previous meteor strike that contained the alien plasmids, so the potential danger was recognized. I'm guessing that the author's reasoning was that a larger unit, such as a battalion, would have brought too much attention from the local people. In any case, this is a fairly minor quibble.Having read other stories by Robert Williams, I expected the writing to be of professional quality, and it was. The story flowed smoothly from scene to scene, and the characters' dialog was realistic. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and the action is pretty much nonstop, ending in an extremely tense and violent climax. Blended smoothly into the action is the relationship between Kelly and Spencer and the blossoming romance that brings them closer together.Editing was generally good, but there were a number of typos in my Kindle version. There weren't enough mistakes to affect my enjoyment of the book, but the author should have proofread his final manuscript more closely.No spoilers here, but after reading ""Peculiar, MO,"" I don't know if I'll ever turn my back on a cat again!The bottom line: This is a first rate page-turner for science fiction and techno-thriller fans.

What I did get was a book that slowly captured my interest and pulled me into its pages. Before I got the e-book, I worried a bit about the plot line as it sounded just like another of the Dan Brown ""wanna-bes""; however, the ""Secret of the Scroll"" by Chester D. Campbell delivers on all levels and is a wonderful read and a thriller that is hard to put down.Retired Air Force OSI Agent Greg McKenzie and his wife Jill are on a trip to the Holy Land. Shortly before they return home, a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase a ""souvenir"" that turns out to be an ancient scroll. When they innocently return home, the McKenzie's world turns upside down as Jill is taken hostage in a battle between militant Palestinians and radical Israelis to recover this ancient scroll. The police, however, target Greg as a suspect in his wife's disappearance, and with a little help from his friends (and a few others), he sets out alone in a perilous chase to save his wife as she is spirited out of America and back to Israel.The ""Secret of the Scroll"" is honestly a classic page-turner; I often kept reading when I knew I should go to sleep. I just kept saying; ""Just one more chapter.""  It is a thriller without a large body count; it is a book about an historical artifact without trying to clone Dan Brown.  Yes, there is plenty of action and intrigue, but the real suspense comes from all of McKenzie's efforts to save his wife while trying to stay a step ahead of the mysterious figures who will stop at nothing to get the scroll. While there are many twists and turns in store for the reader, there is as well a strong realism in the characterization of the main character who seems to be a bit more like your neighbor rather than a James Bond super-hero type. You will like these characters and you will like the book - ""Secret of the Scroll"" (Greg McKenzie Mysteries #1).","09 23, 2012",A3QAC4ZQ5E7OLU,Carl E.

He has derailed his career several times by blowing his lid and spouting off.  Greg has a chip on his shoulder because he feels that his former supervisors and co-workers  have singled him out for retribution.  He's probably right.When Greg and his wife Jill take a trip to the Holy Land with a church group, Greg is supposed to work on his anger management skills.  So when they are returning home at the end of the trip, Greg feels the he and Jill are singled out for unfair treatment by customs and airport security.Then Jill is kidnapped.  The kidnappers, a group of Palestinians, want a scroll that is in Greg's possession.  It seems that a souvenir scroll that Greg bought is actually a real ancient relic.  Then another group, this time radical Israelis, contact him about the scroll.Because of his past actions, Greg cannot count on much help from local law enforcement, or the FBI.  Fortunately, he does have a few friends that help him out.  Greg's investigation leads to a tangled trail of international intrigue.What does the scroll say?Why do two different political groups want the scroll?And, can Greg find a way to stay alive and rescue Jill?In this novel, Chester Campbell has created a unique character.

Toward the end we are told the narrator (of atwoods book) is nameless. This ought to have been stated toward the beginning to eliminate  confusion. Then we are told the nameless narrator is a device to pull readers into the story:&#8220;Read as living myth, Margaret Atwood's fine novel becomes the nameless narrator's service to her community, which now includes us, the thoughtful reader.&#8221;It is difficult for readers to identify with a nameless narrator, but it is challenging for a writer to dare to do this.In this essay, a layered cake is used as the metaphor for the world and our perception of it. The icing represents our surface only existence. Only Shamans can break free to explore all the inner layers.  In the end we are encouraged to take the plunge into knowledge and awaken humanity to the fullness of existence.This book was a confusing book, (and probably also Atwood&#8217;s Surfacing book, which I did not read) which explains/applies the brilliant concepts which are clearly detailed in Joseph Campbell&#8217;s book, Hero of a Thousand Faces.

The story flowed effortlessly from page to page, reeling me in and not letting up until the end. In fact, I found myself thinking about Cade and Elliot later when doing my own chores. But don't get me wrong, thinking about them aside, there were parts that drove me crazy and got under my skin. To me, an emotional attachment is the mark of a great story. This one fit the bill.Cade is a piece of pierced work. He's not about to conform to any standards except the lack of standards. His need to be his own man was endearing. What I loved about him was his fallibility. He's been through a bad relationship and bears the scars, but he's still breathing, still going about his life. I had to hand it to him. Many people would crack, especially after the circumstances he'd lived with, but he didn't.Elliot is the character I wanted to cuddle. Seriously. Handsome, yes. Young, sure. But in his own way, he'd lived through odd circumstances. I wanted to know a bit more about his back story and his foiled attempts at relationships, but given the length of the story, I still enjoyed learning about him. His strength was what drew me to him. He appeared fragile at times, but it merely masked his true devotion to Cade. Great stuff.I can't leave out the love scenes. Ms. Mitchell writes carefully constructed love scenes that never fail to warrant a chilled drink and the need to hunt down that special person. I felt the love and lust between Cade and Elliot when even they weren't sure the experience was more than just sex. The scene in the backseat of ""Bucky"" the Plymouth had me reading and rereading just to savor the experience.If you want a book that's sure to make you blush for the best reasons, you need to read Hot Ticket.

Something I thought was interesting which is not usually touched on was that Cade's ex had been having unsafe sex and he'd been tested but had to wait until his 6 month test came back clean. I always understood that you needed that 6 month window but I know in most books once they get that first test that they are clean everything is bareback city.

Not completely but enough.Basically, Delia is trying to get more people to support the library. It's not doing so well and the Library Appreciation day is coming up and she knows she needs something huge to get people to show. She tells everyone a surprise visitor is coming. Little do they know it's Bobo, the retired hockey player that lives in town and his act has been done over and over again. That is until Justin Archer shows up out of now where. Voted American Woman's sexist man alive. Unfortunately, before Delia could ask him for his help he leaves.Delia finds herself locked in the basement with Justin and he wants to keep their identities secret. Mainly, because he doesn't want the girl to recognize him as the sexiest man alive. What Justin doesn't know is that Delia knows exactly who he is. They talk for hours and hours and really get to know each other. Without being able to see each other.The ending was a little too gooey for me. I'm thinking there should have been some hard feelings in there somewhere. Things don't always work out the way you want them to. I'm thinking if the ending was a little more dragged out, it would have made more sense. Or at least been more believable. It was a cute fast read.","10 4, 2010",A3LHIRT4SR3F9T,"Nikki W.

1197,B00149M19E,"[1, 1]",5,"Ok, so this book is relatively short, coming in around 9200 words, under 40 pages.  Right off the bat it starts with a sexy shower scene - my favorite!  I don't know what it is, but the water, the steam, the whole thing just sets me off.  Here we meet Brett and Lisa, human and vampire, respectively.  And as it turns out, they are in a relationship, eleven months so far.I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.  They respected each other for what they were, and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed, Brett (and I) thought nothing of it.But here I'm going to break off from the characters for a minute to talk about On The Edge, the club.  This place is very much a character in the story, itself.  It's vampire and human friendly, a place for them to meet and mingle, and sometimes even more.  Drink blood, or ""dirty wine"", or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy.  It's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways, loud music, and great ambiance.In the club, Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo.  Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit.  Um, hello, what about Brett??  So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share, I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett's apprehension.But that Lisa, she's a smarty.  And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her, I felt betrayed for Brett, and in a very bad way.  I called Lisa some very bad names.  But like I said, she's smart.  Don't underestimate that girl, and don't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo?  He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books.  I absolutely adore this man, and his lack of inhibitions. He's tall, dark, and handsome.  Sexy and mysterious.  Dangerous.  All of the above, and all things vampire.This story was m-m-f and m-f-m.  And it was so wonderful and beautiful, and unbearably hot.  I definitely recommend it, and I definitely recommend reading it first, before moving on any more in the On The Edge series.","05 19, 2013",A1A7YPC6UBZZIY,Liz @ Fictional Candy,"Sexy and Hot, and all things Wonderful!",1368921600

They're appearance in those stories had piqued my interest.The club On The Edge was only 3 months old but it had been an instant success with the people of Haventown. Both human and vampire alike. It's success was so great that it's owner Brett had to hire more help. After a hard day of interviews he was ready for a quiet night at home. Instead he found himself in whole different, but much more pleasing situation.Though short I loved reading this. Number one, the whole idea of vampires and humans mingling and having fun on the dance floor and in the dark alcoves makes me shiver. It makes me want to put on my dancing shoes and a slinky dress!

1210,B0014BRMKA,"[0, 0]",5,"The traumatic meeting of Emerald Sandford and Asher Wellingham, Duke of Carisbrook occurs five years before the story begins, when she's the 16-year-old member of her nobleman-turned-pirate father's crew and he's the 26-year-old captain of one of his merchant ships. Discovering she's female, Asher refuses to fight her, because, even when beseiged by pirates, a gentleman never harms a lady.  Emerald repays him by knocking him overboard and out of harm's way, not knowing this will make Asher the pirates' captive. It eventually loses him the use of his right hand and his brother his sight. Asher escapes and returns to wipe out the stronghold and kill her father and this is where the story begins. Emerald follows him to England. It isn't for revenge but to retrieve her father's walking stick he took because inside it is the map to a treasure she can use to pay off Beau Sandford's debts and free herself from the past.Using her father's family name and right to a title, Emerald becomes Lady Emma Seaton. Naturally Asher's suspicious of her and intrigued because of her obvious lies and uneasiness in high society. Of course they fall in love but this is more an in-depth study of the main characters attitudes than a mere will-they/won't-they love story. Asher is bound by duty and honor...and extreme guilt. His wife died while he was seeking his revenge, his brother was blinded during his rescue. He returns to his family home a widower, disabled in body, but more disabled in spirit, blaming himself for the tragedies occurring during his own travail. Emerald meanwhile sees herself as the cause. If she hadn't knocked him overboard, none of this would've happened.  Still pursuing her hunt for the walking stick, she believes the only way she can repay Asher for the misery she  has caused is to become his mistress and give him back  the love he lost and remove his grief over his brother's condition.It's an interesting story and an entertaining one, sensuous in spots, but staying away from the ballrooms and usual locales for such tales with most of the action taking place at Asher's estate. Flashbacks give reasons for everything that happens instead of playing them out in detail. Though this is the only James' novel I've read, I got the feeling there may be more on this family because of various hints given. If so, I'd like to read them,too.Harlequin Historical #888This novel was a gift to the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.","06 8, 2014",A3S7REHVBOSTLR,Toni V.

Set in the art world it is filled with spies and political intrigue.Kay McCann is an artist, a Master Artist. She has been involved with two very different men, Peter Lawson a world renowned painter and Jason Allen a gallery owner and expert in art forgeries. Each man has their own agenda where Kay is concerned, each man is manipulative and coldly calculating. Kay unwittingly becomes a pawn between the two men.I enjoyed the premise for this novel. I couldn't quite decide who Kay would ultimely end up with. Kay was a well written character, open, generous and forgiving. IMO too forgiving at times. I did have some qualms for Kay, as she was quite blinded and naive with both Peter and Jason. For a Master Artist who was able to convey so much emotion through her art I expected her to be more &#34;worldly&#34; or aware of what was happening around her,  the repercussions of her actions.I did enjoy this but I do agree with another reviewer that the pace did lag a bit in the middle and it wasn't all tied up as neatly at the end as I would have liked.

1232,B0014YB7LM,"[11, 15]",5,"When deciding whether or not to give this novel a try, keep the old saying in mind: ""Never judge a book by its cover."" The dainty-looking lass gracing ""The May Carousel's"" cover is Kay McCann--a promising California artist and teacher whose personality and life are anything but picture-perfect. Brandishing only a blue streak, she rescues her seemingly soft-spoken English art model, Jason Allen, from a carjacking.  Jason, like Kay, is also not what he seems because once he accepts Kay's offer to mend his wounds, his secret plan for her is hatched.  And once Kay lets Jason through her apartment door, the plan is well on its way; and soon, so are they--from L.A. to London in a tantilizing search for the man who painted Kay's portrait, Peter Lawson: an internationally-renown ""artist"" thought to be dead...until now.""The May Carousel"" adds warmth, maturity, and a degree of realism to the spy genre. It's largely British in tone but more reminiscent of a John Buchan or Alfred Hitchcock romantic mystery than an Ian Fleming or John le Carre Cold War saga. Much like the artwork that populates the novel, author Leslie Wooddavis's characters are well-drawn. Some gravitate more toward the greater good that espionage purports to protect. But for the most part, their lives are more colorful than those living in  le Carre's gray surroundings; and their personalities, deeper than the martini-sipping swagger of the typical 007 stick figure.Kay McCann is a refreshingly humorous and self-reliant woman who is slowly drawn into suave art dealer Jason Allen's snare. But if you think Jason is the villain, again, ""Never judge a book..."" It's another high mark for Wooddavis's style: It's clever in how well it constructs its characters. Genuine love, trust, and friendship begin to sway Jason's thoughts. And Kay recovers the love, trust, and friendship that she thought was lost--felt only in fleeting flashbacks. It all makes for a potent story that builds to a truly stunning--though regrettably sensible--conclusion that will catch most readers by surprise.If the story itself is compelling, the pace lags in places--particularly in the middle. The beginning has a strong hook, with the introduction of Jake Thorton (Jason's smarmy American associate who is as adept at the art of deception as he is art dealing). Jason's wooing of Kay is a bit too involved at the start, but does the trick. But once the proceedings reach London, the novel spends too much time sorting through a love triangle. Though a few car chases and Kay's melees with would-be kidnappers help put things back in perspective, the excessive emphasis placed on romantic complexities almost undermines the greater idea: That art and romance are tactics in a bigger game being played.Still, Leslie Wooddavis triumphs in delivering a first-rate read--effective storytelling highlighted by a memorable cast of characters brought to life by a plot and dialog that  switch from sentimental to self-controlled on a dime. But best of all, ""The May Carousel"" is unique in its ability to add human warmth to the spy story scene--a genre that is typically a cold-blooded battle royal of barbs, bullets, and bombs.","12 15, 2011",AV64Y0L3C45UX,James Blakley,May adds warmth to typically cold-blooded spy genre,1323907200

Frankly it was like he was being paid to write a story of so many words for a magazine and he suddenly realized that he needed to finish so the story quickly and abruptly ends.The story starts off well like one of Andre Norton's space interplanetary exploration teams making first contact with a new race.  The man assigned the task of making first contact knows the new race cannot be trusted and he knows that they have captured a space ship.  Suddenly within a few questions he solves the puzzle of where the ship is and turns the tables on his captor.  The story ends so quickly it makes you wonder why you wasted your time reading it.  It is only about 30 minutes of reading time so if you have an interest in the book then go ahead and enjoy it.

Much like he'd like to grab her...Never has blackmail looked so dang good!  Marie Harte's newest release with Samhain Publishing, Enjoying the Show leaves me wondering if I should take up voyeurism as a hobby myself!  And if I had a neighbor like Gage Warren, I think I just might.  After all, it worked out very well for Hailey, did it not?  lolDespite the blackmail, Gage certainly never forces Hailey into anything she does not want.  In fact, he goes out of his way to leave her with choices, needing her to realize how much she cares for him and that this is not just a temporary sexual fling, but a real relationship to him.Although she trusts Gage, Hailey is nevertheless slow to trust his feelings for her as anything more than transient.  But having gotten her attention with some really great sex, Gage easily wins her heart with his unending patience and the ways he shows her how much she means to him as a person and friend, instead of just a bed partner.Every time I read another Marie Harte story, I become a bigger fan of this talented author.

1254,B0015YEQ6O,"[22, 28]",4,"Hailey Jennison was uncomfortable with her body, and had always been shy because of it.  She had developed early, and had to constantly deal with unwanted attention from men.  She didn't go out very often, but did enjoy getting together with her friends on Friday nights.  They had recently become obsessed with a neighbor that provided an exciting sideshow for them.  He is a construction worker named Gage Warren with an incredibly sculpted body he didn't mind showing them frequently.  One night when Gage caught them looking in his windows, they scattered, but not fast enough because before she knew it Hailey had been dragged to his apartment.  He had been attracted to Hailey from the first moment he saw her, and now that he saw his chance, he was going to take it.After they had been together a couple of weeks, Hailey finally told him what he had known all along.  She was afraid he would leave if they didn't have sex, and equated it to her dad leaving her when she was just a small child.  Gage couldn't believe she didn't get it.  He was completely in love with her, and now he just had to get her to believe it.  There was no way he would let her get away.Gage and Hailey are a fun couple.  Hailey has a lot of issues to work out, but Gage loves her and is willing to wait as long as it takes so they can be together forever.  His family is also priceless.  Most people have meddlesome family members, but the fact that two of his work in the mental health field, make the dynamics even more comical since they feel compelled to constantly give advice.","06 13, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Enjoying the Show,1213315200

She gets together with her friends every Friday to watch the hot neighbor who walks around naked in his apartment without closing his curtains. They don't know his name so they call him Mr. Tool; partly because they can tell he works construction, partly because they've seen his massive ""hammer"".The hottie catches her in the parking lot and tells her he knows they've been watching him. He says she needs to come discuss the situation in private or he'll call the cops. Once inside his apartment, he gives her a choice: take him to dinner, or go to jail for peeping.Gage Warren had wanted to meet Hailey for months, then she moved out of the apartment complex and he was afraid he had missed his opportunity. Now that he's got her, he knows he doesn't ever want to let her go.Enjoying the Show by Marie Harte is a fantastic book with lava-hot sex and characters who quickly realize that what they're feeling is a lot more than mere lust. Gage and Hailey are immensely likeable because both have trouble talking to the opposite sex and both have trouble with relationships. Their imperfections make readers really care about their budding relationship. I love that they feel like they're addicted to each other. Enjoying the Show is extremely well-written and believable, and readers will love seeing Hailey and Gage explore their feelings for each other.

1270,B0015YEQ6O,"[1, 2]",4,"~* 3.5 Stars *~It's innocent, if slightly indecent fun. About as indecent as the shy and a little uptight Hailey Jennison gets, actually. She and her friends get together every Friday night for some very specific girl time. Gathering around the window in her friend's apartment, lights off, snacks and drinks in hand, they look out the window and down into the apartment of the man they refer to as Mr. Tool.The man is smoking hot and has a habit of walking around his apartment barely clothed, sometimes not clothed at all (and aren't those happy nights!), with his lights on and his shades up. Hey, a girl's gotta grab whatever salacious fun she can, right? It's harmless and he's the man of her dreams - literally. Then she goes out to get some more booze for the girl's night and Mr. Tool confronts her about her and her friends' weekly activities.Mr. Tool...Gage for those who actually know him as more than just a bit of man candy, gives Hailey an ultimatum. Either she goes out on a date with him, or he calls the cops and files a complaint about her and her friends' weekly peeping.For six months Gage has been hoping for a chance with Hailey. She had moved out of the complex before he worked up the courage to talk to her, but he caught her and her friends spying on him one night and has gone out of his way to make sure she has plenty to see ever since. True, blackmailing the woman for a date isn't exactly the most gallant thing he's ever done, but it got the job done. Finally. Now, if he can just manage to get through the date without opening his mouth and sticking one or both feet into it.To say Gage is socially awkward around women would be a gross understatement. It makes starting a relationship hard, especially when he is as attracted to a woman as he is Hailey. A little blackmail seems a small matter for his pride, though, if it gets him a shot with Hailey.~*~This deliciously erotic little bit of yumminess was fun for a hot, quick read. The plot was a bit light, and I'm not sure I bought the whole gorgeous-guy-has-to-blackmail-a-girl-for-a-date concept, but the characters were likable and the sex was abundant and hot. Sometimes, that's all I need to be happy with an erotic novella like this.I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.I wish that Harte had pushed the envelope of Gage's awkwardness around women even further, because he never really struck me that way when he was around Hailey. He certainly wasn't Mr. Charming, but to have built up the level of neurosis he had over his lack of ability to speak to women without saying something wrong, I would have expected him to be much, much worse than he was. Maybe if he'd been even more blunt, or less endearing with his clumsiness, I would have bought into it a bit more.Hailey didn't do much for me, really. She didn't annoy, but she's too familiar as the uptight, tightly wound Type A personality bordering on prissy. The girl with a killer bod and an ice maiden exterior fashioned from her fear of pain. I wish more originality had gone into her character, but she at least held her own.I'm not a fan of the quick-to-love theme in romance, even in erotic novellas. That, for me, was the bigger issue with the story. I wish the romance had been given a longer lead time, even if it had been in condensed form. I also would have liked a meatier plot, and I'm no fan of relationship conflict that's nothing more than a failure to communicate, as it was here. Those are the things that held me back from completely liking what I read.It was hot, though, I'll say that. And I do have a soft spot for the themes of unrequited love (or lust) and love (lust) from afar, like Gage had for Hailey. He was kind of geeky-cute with his affections and I enjoyed that aspect very much. For a quick read that will definitely raise a gal's body temp, I'd recommend this one, but I personally would have liked more story and a less annoying conflict.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","04 13, 2012",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Sexy Little Bite of Yum,1334275200

She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","03 19, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

She almost had it all in Parker West, but he was predictable, boring, and proposed to her in a most unromantic way.  Celia was not selfish, but she refused to settle for less than everything, so she turned down the unacceptable proposal.  When Parker showed up at her front door, tied her up, and carried her off to an unknown location, she was frightened, but yet excited by his spontaneity.Parker was risking everything on this last chance effort.  He had known the difficult Celia all his life, and being a kind gentleman had gotten him nowhere, so he hoped unleashing his darker dominant side might penetrate her steel defenses.  When they arrived at his cabin, she responded to this side of him better than he could have ever anticipated.  If he would have known this was all it took, he would have introduced this aspect of his sexuality years ago.  His next proposal, although done while both of them were naked and in bed, was readily accepted.When neighbor Rance Colter tried to stop the quickie wedding in town, Parker knew it was only a sign of things to come.  He knew that Rance had wanted to claim Celia for his own, but she had never wanted him in return.  Now that Celia was his, Parker set up extra protection at his ranch as well as Celia's.  He didn't put anything past Colter, and knew he would try something soon.  Her being married would not stop him.  That is one thing Parker had no doubt about.  When Celia was abducted from home, both families swore she would be returned unharmed whatever the cost.A traditional formula that works well with this story.

1306,B0015YEQNM,"[1, 1]",4,"This is the complete trilogy, plus a short story, of Poison Study (Book 1), Magic Study (Book 2), and Fire Study (Book 3).Poison Study was Ms. Snyder's debut novel, and it was excellent! I borrowed the hard copy, and enjoyed it so much, I immediately bought the Bundle so I would have all the books, and all in the same place. I will be buying more of Ms. Snyder's books!These books are what I would call High Fantasy, though there are no dragons. There are Sorcerers, Magicians, and of course, Mundanes - no dragons. I believe they would easily cross to a genre I seldom read and even more seldom enjoy, Romance.As I read fiction for escape, this was perfect! I could escape into a world lush with characters, geography, and conflict.Poison Study starts off with our heroine, Yelena, being brought out of her cell in the dungeon to stand before the #2 man of the country. He gives her a choice. She can face the executioner for her crime of killing the son of a noble, or she can face the possibility of a slow and agonizing death at some future date, and become the official taster of the Commander (who runs the country.)Because there might be a way for her to escape, and this is at the beginning of the story, she accepts the latter. An honest person, she wins either the fast and loyal friendship of many, or the undying hatred.When the Commander took over the country, he outlawed all magic, seeing it as evil, and any who had abilities either did their best to escape to Ixia, where magic was not only allowed, but nurtured, or were killed trying.As the story unfolds, we learn Yelena was an orphan, taken and raised under the protection and education of General Brazell (whose son she killed). By the end of the story, we learn she was not an orphan, but had been kidnapped for her hoped for, and anticipated, magical abilities.Life for Yelena was not pleasant in the orphanage, and only slightly more pleasant as a Taster, but at least it was life.Magic Study finds Yelena reunited with her birth family, and on her way to learning to use and control her magic. Again, her choice is: Learn to use it, or burn yourself out, unless killed first.In Magic Study, she finds herself in a strange place, untrusted, even by her brother, accused of being a spy, with few friends, and a nasty habit of charging ahead without thinking everything through.Fire Study is the third and final book in the trilogy. Yelena finds her true magic, which frightens everyone, including her. She is a Soulfinder, one of the most powerful of all magics. By now all the characters are known, or at least most of them, and we're aware of Yelena's foibles, and her undying loyalties.She tries to avert a war, is caught, imprisoned, escapes, and has a price on her head. The First Magician wants her dead, the Fire Starter wants her soul, and the Commander's Assassin wants her.For the most part, this was a page burner. Once I started reading it, it was very difficult to put down. So why only 4 stars? Because Ms. Snyder knows better than to use lazy language such as, ""Me and him..."" and the 3d and final book had entirely too many of those. Each time I read that phrase, it threw me out of the story, and I had to work my way back in. It jarred. The more of them I read, the stronger the jar.Although ""Me and...."" drives me crazy, it may not bother you. Perhaps that is the way you speak and write, and you have no idea it is the epitome of laziness in the use of American English; if so, it won't bother you, and you will probably not even notice.The stories were great fun. I look forward to my next Maria V. Snyder novel. She has a wonderful imagination, and a great ability to create new and interesting worlds.","10 20, 2013",A1O2I3BAX8FXZN,Rainy Day,"Study Hard, Do Your Homework, and Become a Magician",1382227200

Ever since his death, Ethan, Dan's best friend and business partner becomes close to Sophia and her daughter. He is secretly lusting and loving Sophia but is afraid of telling her.  She has become close to Ethan over the last few months.

Sophia was scared of things she was feeling for her husband's best friend.  She needed to escape and decides to go on a cruise by herself to clear her head and be away.

She just needs some time and space to figure out what she wants for the rest of her life, and whether or not her feelings for Ethan are real or just a by-product of their close friendship.Ethan has been waiting for the right opportunity to let Sophia know just how he feels about her.  Having been careful to give her space in which to grieve her late husband, he has bided his time in reluctant patience - he'll be damned if he misses his chance with her now.  Determined to finally make his move and tell the lovely widow just how much she means to him, he moves heaven and earth to land himself on the same cruise.  He'll pull out all the stops to make both of their dreams come true, praying that those dreams will be possible together.Home for Christmas is an absolutely wonderful tale about a mature romance between two friends who have long loved each other from afar.  With a starring couple who are both over forty, Kate Davies offers a realistic look at love the second time around for those of us who are long past the first bloom of youth, but still young enough to entertain dreams of love and forever.As a no-nonsense widow and the mother of a young adult daughter, Sophia is mindful of her family's needs, while still being very aware of her own as a woman.  When the death of her husband left her as part-owner in his business, she never hesitated to roll up her sleeves and work in the family business alongside her friend and partner, Ethan.  She knows Ethan would do anything for her, but worries that her growing romantic ideas about him are born of their close proximity and her dependence on his presence in her life.  While she is ready to admit her feelings, she needs time away to be sure of them before running the risk of damaging their friendship.Of course, Ethan wouldn't be our story's hero if he let her get away with that.  The man is romantically relentless, determined that he won't spend Christmas apart from the woman he loves more than anything.  Even still, he gives her every chance to keep him at arm's length once he arrives on board the cruise ship, while hoping deep down inside that she doesn't take those opportunities.  But Ethan means to make this relationship last for the rest of their lives, and his resolve that Sophia be sure of not just his feelings for her but hers for him are heart-warming.Home for Christmas is a wonderfully inspiring romance that will make readers rejoice in the belief that new life and new love can most certainly happen no matter your age.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**","03 23, 2008",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,4.5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1206230400

Why didn't they look for the other wolf who was with Heather?

It also doesn't have any sex scenes and character development is shallow at best, with the exception of the heroine, Heather.Heather is the human mate to two wolf shapeshifters; when buying supplies, Heather, friend and shapeshifter Niko and her mates' father are ambushed by hunters.  To make a short story shorter, Heather is blamed by her mates who think she was responsible for the attack which ended in their father's death.  She's gravely injured, yet they turn their back on her and leave her to die.  She's rescued by a hunter (a good one this time) who tries to nurse her back to life.What follows is standard typical romance stuff and would be spoilers, if that's possible.  What makes this story very good for me is more about what's left out.  This isn't erotica, despite the steamy books Banks usually writes.  I don't know if it could even be called a romance, since there's not a lot of romancing going on.  It's more of a love story; characters torn apart because of a misunderstanding and brought back together not because of hot sex, but rather love and the ability to forgive.  I didn't particularly like the mates and if it were me, they'd have been kicked back to the pack and I'd have run off with Niko.This isn't a perfect story; things get wrapped up far too soon and because of the length and that fact that nearly all of the narrative focuses on Heather, her mates get the short end of the stick in terms of character development.  They go from feeling betrayed to wallowing in grief because of what they did in a very, very short amount of time.  There are only really five characters and no explanations at all of things like the pack and how Heather came to be with them.Still, this is a nice, sweet story that can be read in an hour.

They will do anything to make it up to Heather and earn her forgiveness, but is it too late?  Has her trust in them been irrevocably broken?Leave it to Maya Banks to have me bawling my eyes out over the Christmas holiday.  With her holiday release, Love Me, Still, Ms. Banks tore my heart to shreds.  Between my past experience with this author's stories and the publisher's synopsis, I really should have expected as much, in hindsight.Never has Maya Banks' ability to instill empathy for her characters in the reader been more evident than in this story.  I felt everything that Heather felt.  I ached when she ached for the loss of her mates.  I sobbed when she cried over the hurt she saw in her mates' eyes when they believed she had betrayed them.  And when they returned to her, I felt the same joy Heather did at her return to the mates and the pack she so cherished.In the midst of all that raw emotion, it never occurred to me what the story didn't have.  It wasn't until later as I reminisced over the story that it struck me - this is the first Maya Banks title I have ever read that has no sex scene.  You read that right - none whatsoever.  And you know what?  As much as I have enjoyed this author's undeniable talent at crafting love scenes that would melt the paint off a car, I didn't even notice it wasn't there while I read the story.  It worked very well without it.  In fact, I would venture so far to say that if adding a sex scene to this story meant cutting any other part of the tale, I would absolutely not want it.  Love Me, Still was that perfect.  If anyone should doubt Maya Banks' writing talent, this story can be held up as a prime example of her ability to stir emotions without needing sex to do so.When I am in the mood for a good tearjerker with a beautiful love story featuring the reuniting of lovers, Love Me, Still will be the book I reach for time and again.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**","03 23, 2008",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1206230400

Scott has been biding his time just waiting for his chance to show Tara they can be more than just friends.  With her recent break-up from her louse of a boyfriend and her subsequent need to show the bum she is serious about the break-up, Scott offers himself up to play the part of her new boyfriend.  Of course, Scott just happens to be into method acting, and this is the role of his lifetime...Tara isn't so sure about Scott's plan - especially when it involves moving in with him, albeit temporarily.  But when his family makes her a business offer that is too good to be true, she can't refuse.  One little problem: how will she ever be able to keep her hands off her hunky friend while living in such close proximity?  Scott could never be interested in a woman like her - could he?Fans of Annmarie McKenna's work will be delighted when they recognize the hero of Look What Santa Brought as the very same Scott Wyatt we first met in her book Blackmailed.  Yes, this is the same Scott that is Brianna's little brother!  Of course, this new story takes place years later and Scott is one very sexy adult man now, ready for his own shot at romance with the woman of his dreams.Scott has certainly grown up right, now running his own business and enjoying life almost to the fullest.  The only thing missing in his life is love.  Sure, his looks pave the way for him with most women, but many regard him as nothing more than a curious fling due to his blindness.  Tara is one of the few women that treats him just like any other man, which he most certainly is.  Despite his disability, Scott is more than capable of taking care of both himself and the woman he loves.Tara is a woman in a situation many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves in at one time of having suddenly found herself in a potentially abusive relationship.  Determined to rid herself of the man trying to control her life and stand on her own, she is at first understandably reluctant to accept Scott's offer to help.  That reluctance only increases as things take a dangerous turn and she is unwilling to put either Scott or his family at risk.  Of course, the valiant Scott is not one to take no for an answer, especially regarding the safety of the woman he has loved for so long.Although a short story, Look What Santa Brought affords us a `where are they now' glimpse into the lives of Scott's sister and her men, reinforcing one happy ever after while delivering another in the form of Scott and Tara's relationship.This sexy little story may have a holiday theme, but Look What Santa Brought is undeniably a story that will be enjoyed by romance fans no matter the time of year.

If I had to put my finger on what was wrong about this book, it would be that there was hardly any back-story to the characters.  The author also relied on conclusive statements that seemed to come out of the blue, rather than letting the characters' motivations and reasoning evolve naturally through the story.It was actually a chore to get myself to finish reading the book, starting from about a third of the way into it.  Not that the first third of the book was any better - that's just how long I would give an author to warm up and hook me into their story.  The sex scenes were too frequent and too long, to the point that the underlying story was never developed in any meaningful way.  It's ebooks like this that make me miss the ability to jump ahead in a paper book, quickly flipping past several pages until I can see where a particularly boring scene has ended and the story picks up again.

I hope you'll also note the publisher's review that implies very mild BDSM and lots and lots of sex.  Don't download this book if you're gonna have a problem with sex on a first date, explicit sexual language and graphic descriptions of sex or people having, you know, sex.To call this a PNR is a stretch because it's way too erotic to be a romance.  And apparently it's not erotic enough to be called erotica for some picky people.  If the rest of the story is only a conveyance to get the couple in bed, in my mind that's erotica even if it's tame.Okay, so now if you're still interested, please get this book!  You won't be disappointed.  This is a straightforward story with a very simple plot.  It's not superior storytelling; I would have liked more character development on both sides, and the dialogue is not great.  But, ultimately, I read erotica so I can get jazzed up and go jump my husband; this book definitely, erm, scored in that regard.  I hate contrived drama between the male and female who could clear everything up if they only talked about their feelings or asked the right question.  The couple in this story had a problem and voila, they talked about it so they could move on to the good part.  What a concept.So, yes, the sex, there's a lot of it.  Just because nobody gets a ball gag in their mouth doesn't mean it's not hot.  The couple connected, had chemistry and the scene where she's doing the monster, holy smoke... well done.","07 18, 2011",AQPZ9T7Q4OPUR,Lorijay,Fun Erotic Read,1310947200

To do this, they need the assistance of some humans in the entertainment industry.  They decide to go with Calypso Productions, but the meeting is a disaster.  In the end, Luke asks one of the women to meet again somewhere else, hoping he can convince her to help in a less formal setting.  The woman, Lena, asks him to dinner.  Though he's nervous--and attracted to Lena--Luke agrees.Lena has risen to a position of influence as a founding member of Calypso Productions.  Together with her three friends, she's one of Hollywood's young elite.  Normally she would blow off a guy who gives a presentation as awkwardly as Luke and his friends did.  Since she finds him attractive, however, she asks him to dinner with the intention of seducing him.  Will Lena still want Luke when she discovers what he and his friends are?Lights, Camera...Monsters is a cute and interesting tale of what happens when an up-and-coming Hollywood businesswoman meets a monster, literally.  Lena is secure in her own place in the world, and proud of her accomplishments.  She's tough and knows what she wants.  Luke, with his mixture of toughness and tenderness, confidence and vulnerability, throws her for a loop.  The scene in which she first sees Luke's true form is really funny.  I liked Luke's navet&eacute; regarding human customs, and his uncertainty.  He softened some of Lena's grating edges.  The storyline itself is engaging, with lots of sex, some action and suspense, and a rather unusual take on the paranormal/monster genre.

1353,B0015Z7VWE,"[1, 4]",1,"I appreciate that the author was trying to go someplace fresh in PNR (goodness knows we've got enough vampires and werewolves out there), but I don't think this book was a success.I really hate romance/erotic novels where the female main character is presented as having an important or high powered career, meets the hero, and then doesn't even think about work for the rest of the book.  The first chapter takes place at work and Lena literally doesn't work for the rest of the book.  The world of work presented here isn't realistic either.  It just doesn't make sense that five college friends, all in their twenties, would be able to set up a super successful Hollywood production company - especially when they rely on their receptionist to set up meetings for them and he does it on the basis of whether or not the guys are cute.  This is far from a minor detail in the book - Lena's job is supposedly how she meets the male main character in the first place.It was disturbing how quickly Lena adopted Luke as a ""pet,"" buying him clothes, telling people to keep their hands off of him, being charmed by his failure to understand human society (and while we're at it, why bother to create a whole new class of beings for your books but then stick with the whole ""he doesn't really understand humans/good sex mates him for life/he is violently possessive"" thing that plagues most PNRs?), and telling her friends (in front of him!) very specific details about how good he is in bed.  I'm so sick of the message that all every woman of minimal accomplishment wants is a guy who will be willing to have slightly deviant sex with her while being so turned on by her that he'll feel compelled to rape her when he even imagines her with another man (which, yes, actually happens here).  While this might not work with an actual woman, Lena is a bit more one-dimensional.  She's sassy!  She's been hurt by men!  She's always on a diet!  She likes mochas!  Her living room is decorated with high heeled shoes and knick knacks from Anthropologie!  She's presumably JUST LIKE YOU or JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WANT TO BE, all she needs is a monster to make her complete (and maybe rape her on the couch!)The plot doesn't really exist other than the sex - there's a flimsy and easily resolved conflict and the rest of the time is spent setting up Lena's beautiful and super cool friends to star in future books.  They're women of accomplishment also, so it should be no time before they realize that their entire life was worthless until they met a macho monster to dominate them.","07 20, 2011",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,Boring,1311120000
1354,B0015Z7VWE,"[1, 2]",4,"I did enjoy this book but it's definitely more about the sex marathons between Lena and Luke than ""the plot"" that could kill them as Luke tries to save his people. The writing was decent and I did like the character of Luke but the story could still use some work. This edition could still use some editing and the author has the annoying tendency of constantly identifying the characters rather than switching to he or she after the first few times. It pulled me out of the story occasionally but it's not a major issue. The sex does tend to go on for a while but there are some definitely hot moments. The whole scene with Luke in his ""monster"" form was pretty ridiculous but it didn't ruin the entire book for me. I got a little confused with all the characters thrown into this story (obviously to set up future books in the series) with 5 best friends including Lena plus Luke and his 2 buddies I couldn't really keep up with who's who when they all got together. There's a small bit of action in the story but Luke's quest to make this movie doesn't actually happen in this story, I'm sure it's going to be prolonged over the course of the series so be warned this is definitely a story about Lena and Luke's relationship or sex life really than anything else. I feel the author missed an opportunity to expand on the life and world of the monsters but overall I liked it for what it was and it's definitely good if your just looking for a little steamy bit of escapist fluff.","07 22, 2011",A1MV7V2HX2PE6Z,Rebekah Rae,More Erotica Than Action Suspense,1311292800

They're hip, trendy, and current, and they're building a stellar name for themselves in the industry by focusing on quality entertainment. She is always on the lookout for promising new clients, but never had that promise held more appeal than when three utterly delicious men walk into the conference room. It may have been the worst sales pitch she'd ever heard, but the apparent front man of the three, a stunningly gorgeous man named Luke, stirs all sorts of juices in Lena. Despite the waste of time the meeting turns out to be professionally, she suggests a further discussion between the two of them that night over dinner.It wouldn't have been difficult for the dinner to go much better than the meeting had, but even Lena is surprised to find out that above and beyond how attractive she finds Luke physically, she is even more entertained by his companionship. Their chemistry is off the charts and the sex is phenomenal. There is, in fact, nothing that could dim the exquisite memory of the best night of her life...until she wakes up, rolls over, opens her eyes, and sees a seven-foot tall, winged, fanged, shaggy monster in bed next to her.That's pretty much when the screaming starts.Convinced some monster had eaten her new lover, Lena is both terrified and pissed, and it takes a hurt and embarrassed Luke a while to calm her down enough to explain that he hadn't been eaten and he is, in fact, a monster. And that he and his friends had come to her company in desperate hope that they could help launch a preemptive campaign to prepare humanity for their existence without sparking panic and causing the relentless slaughter of the last of his kind.Hollywood: gateway to public opinion and recent home to a sex god of a monster. Lena does so love that town.I have to admit, a quick read of the product description of the book before I downloaded it to my Kindle gave me the impression thatLights, Camera...Monstersis a paranormal romance. I should've payed closer attention to the warning, because this is definitely an erotic paranormal romance. It's an important distinction; a fact made crystal clear when I wasn't anticipated it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I like erotic paranormal romance. But in this case, it created a few problems for me.It's not just about the amount of sex in the book, which is a lot, or the level of graphic description, also a lot. Nor is it the light kink, which was fine. It was the fact that all of those things combined and became the largest part of the story by far, substituting romance for sex, eclipsing an anemic external conflict plot thread, providing virtually no character development, and overwhelming the limited world building and mythos creation.The concept of the story is a bit kitschy and kooky, but it is definitely original. The characters were ill-defined and two dimensional, but endearing (especially Luke). There was more than one plot hole, but the guilty pleasure I took in the humor and random bouts of comedy kept me from focusing too heavily on it. And the external conflict was appallingly bereft of development and was so quickly resolved it was laughable, yet...I can't deny that I found it all rather entertaining.I had a hard time believing that the monsters call their species monsters, though. That bothered me a lot, and didn't make a lot of sense in the big picture. They have their own language and their own culture, have hidden themselves away from people, but they define their species based on human preconceptions and labels? That didn't track for me.Yet despite the drawbacks, I found myself oddly drawn in and more than a little captivated by Luke in particular, whose intense efforts to fit in completely charmed me more than once. I wish there had been more time allotted to Luke and Michael and Henry together, because their scenes were showstoppers. And I didn't detest Lena, which is definitely a point in the books favor.In truth, I wish I had started the book with the advanced awareness of its erotic nature, because I think my expectations would have been different and I would have enjoyed the read even more. That being said, I can't complain at the price I paid (gotta love those free Kindle downloads), and don't feel like it was a waste of time. In fact, there was enough promise and potential in DuBois' writing that I'm interested in checking out the rest of the series in the hopes that the smutty, sexual, lightly kinky fun shares the page with a more well-rounded and better conceived plot and fully formed characters.Warning: This book contains graphic scenes of sex and alternative sexual situations including but not limited to: light BDSM, anal sex, and monster sex.

It's not a great story, but it does provide the background to the series, and from what I've heard it is not reflective of the author's usual writing. It's worth reading (esp. for free) if you want the background info. Briefly the prequel tells the story of Kadence, the goddess of oppression, and Geryon the gaurdian of the gate of Hell. It's a short story that tells of their love and their quest to fortify the Gate/wall of Hell as well as the subsequent creation of Pandora's Box. The story is bitter sweet. The ending is a little off (anyone who knows anything about poisionous animals would agree - you'll understand if you read it - but it's paranormal fiction anyway, so whatever.).

This is the story of how/why the dimOuniak (aka Pandora's Box) was created.The Lords of the Underworld series currently has 4 books in the series:The Darkest Night (Lords of the Underworld, Book 1)- Maddox, the keeper of the demon of violence.The Darkest Kiss (Lords of the Underworld, Book 2)- Lucien, keeper of the demon of death and leader of the Budapest warriors.The Darkest Pleasure (Lords of the Underworld, Book 3)- Reyes, the keeper of the demon of pain.This one is available August 2009 -The Darkest Whisper (Lords of the Underworld)- Sabin, the keeper of the demon of doubt and leader of the Greek warriors.","07 1, 2009",A71W7G4TCTH3T,"BBMoreB ""Heather Coulter""",Geryon and Kadence,1246406400

The prologue doesn't necessarily have to be really long or the length of the average book, it should just be long enough to set up everything for the series including the tone of it all.The reader is introduced to the Guardian of Hell-Geyron a beastly grotesque creature, and the Goddess of Oppression- Kadence who is beautiful beyond words.  Both have been stationed by their respective sides to guard and protect the wall into hell.  Kadence is bound to the wall so much so that if it crumbles she will die.  Geyron sold his soul to Lucifer and for that he is positioned to make sure that everything in hell stays there.  Kadence and Geyron have held these positions for centuries and they have never spoken until now.  Even though there were no words passed between them there was a mutual respect and attraction.The wall is beginning to show signs of damage and Kadence has to figure out a way to repair it.  Geyron could not help, even though he desperately wanted to.  In order to save the wall Kadence ended up making a deal with Lucifer, one she would later realize was a mistake.  While trying to repair the wall and take down the Demon Lords, Geyron and Kadence vocalize their feelings, desires, and wants for one another.  This is where it starts to get messy.  The Demon Lords have begun to truly destroy the wall.  Without revealing too much I will say that in the end all the Demon Lords are stuck in Pandora's Box.All in all I really enjoyed this The Darkest Fire.Visit us at Fairytales4grownups.com for the full review and everything Romance Novels like many more reviews and our blog.","04 22, 2012",A1XA42JUD8X134,FairyTales4GrownUps,Fairytales4grownups.com Review,1335052800

Instead it is the story of the origins of the box which originally imprisoned the demons before being intrusted to Pandora.  It is a beauty and the beast style romance between the beastly Guardian of the Gate to the Underworld and the beautiful Goddess of Opression whose strength keeps the walls of the Hell intact and the demons (lust, death, wrath, disease...) from being unleashed on the mortal world. It very much has the same type of feel as P.C. Cast's Goddess of the Rose with the romance between a creature that sees himself as so ugly that doesn't dare to hope that the beauteous object of his affection could see beyond his skin to his noble heart, it also has a similar type of bittersweet happily ever after. I thought that this was a nice little tease to the series before it hit the bookstores, and now that the books are out it's a brief 'just so' historical note to the series, since the box is what got all the Lords into an eternity of trouble.  One caution though to readers, if you find a love between beings of two physically different species uncomfortable, this may not be the story for you.","05 16, 2008",A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7,melindeeloo,3.5 Stars - Prequel to Showalter's Lords of the Underworld,1210896000

1370,B0015Z7WL4,"[2, 2]",3,"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsA semi interesting back-story and I didn't care for the writing style. For some reason I had expected something way more intense since there seems to be so much buzz about the Lords of the Underworld series. To me the writing seemed kind of amateurish. I'm going to give the rest of the books a chance though because I did buy The Darkest Fire as part of a Lords of the Underworld bundle package and I am curious on the relevance of this prequel.Regarding the hero in the story, as admirable as Geryon was, the description of hooves, fur and horns was a big turn off. I just wasn't feeling the draw at all. Even creepy as he seemed more animal than human.The idea that Pandora's box was built from a Goddess' bones was really cool and I think that I may have enjoyed The Darkest Fire more if I had read it after the first book in the series, The Darkest Night. Perhaps I could have appreciated the importance of Pandora's box more. As for the The Darkest Fire being a stand alone little story; I'd not suggest reading it alone and then giving up. More forward with The Darkest Night and then make your decision if you liked it or not. Since I went ahead and read The Darkest Night right away, that moved my rating for this book from a 2 to a 3.

The wall has a crack in it and Kadence bargains with Lucifer to allow Geryon to help her repair it.

The Earl of Vailmont doesn't believe the rumors, however, and is determined to prove his theory that there is no magic involved. In typical rouge fashion, he sets out to show his friends that he can associate with women without getting caught. Unfortunately, he chooses Sylvia to experiment with and becomes attracted to her. This pits Val against Sylvia in a game of pursuit as old as time.You can read this for the fun, surface story of magical love potions, lusty protagonists, and fears of marriage and really enjoy this book. You can also read this for the underlying story where both Val and Sylvia have suffered  great losses--loss that has always stood in the way of true happiness and finding love. Though they each approach their losses--betrayal, moral dilemmas, death, in different ways it is that approach and that desire to find love that is for me the real conflict in this story and what puts it above many others in this genre.","11 28, 2010",A1PMYWK6CVJJNI,MaggieMae,Rogues Get Caught,1290902400

And along with this hot sexiness, the author also gives us a sweet romance.So you know the main story- girl wins lottery and falls for her financial planner. What you don't know is that the girl is afraid to love. I won't tell you why specifically, but she does have reasons for how she feels about love, relationships, and men in general. Her motto is keep things clean and neat and no one gets hurt.Brittney treats men as disposable playthings. She owns her sexuality and has no qualms about having fun, hot sex flings. Because of her past, Brittney's relationships with men are more hormonal rather than emotional. She reduces them to basic need; there is no love or tenderness, no expectation of tomorrow. She does not date and does not know what a 'normal' relationship with a man would even look like.Enter our hero, Charlie, who is nice, normal, solid and hot as hell. I'd call him a sexy geek. He's a tall, fit number cruncher with dark hair and eyes and these cute wire-rimmed glasses. And Brittney drives him crazy. They are so opposite, but the attraction between them builds and builds. Without really understanding the why or how of this sexual chemistry between them, they decide to let the attraction play out, but only as a quickie here and there.This is more at Brittney's insistence. She's so afraid to feel anything but lust for a man. Mention love and she's out the door. But poor Charlie, he's a man ready for a commitment, for happily ever after. He wants a woman to take care of and to spend the rest of his life with. And he's determined to make Brittney see things his way.I just loved Charlie! Even that solid, stand-by-you name of his. Every woman deserves a Charlie. I could just kiss him. He is so patient with Brittney. He really gentles her, quiets her fears, and treats her like something special.And let's not forget that hot sex. Sex in the office, sex in a public restroom, more sex in the office, and then lastly, a very tender but sexy scene as love words are finally confessed.This is a novella, but it is packed with a sweet love story and some HOT sex. I really enjoyed it; I loved both characters a lot. Brittney thinks to seduce Charlie into a fast, no strings affair, but it is Charlie who seduces Brittney into accepting the love of one good, true man.There are books about Britt's two best friends as well-Book 2Fortune's Promise: : Fortune, Book 2Book 3Fortune's Chance: : Fortune, Book 3","05 26, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S.

1414,B0016IXMCI,"[8, 8]",5,"Under advisement of her editor, romance author Julia Martin is about to embark on a new venture - writing erotic romances.  Unfortunately she doesn't have any experience in anything but vanilla (and even that was a very long time ago).  The erotic books her editor Ross leant her have her imagination in overdrive and him starring as the hero in every single fantasy.Over the past decade she's locked herself away from the world with only her cat Duke for company - and of course the Thursday night pizza date with Ross.  Two months ago her beloved companion Duke passed away leaving her depressed, lonely and in a funk that she's been unable to shake.  Ross suggested she make a major change in her life and offered his cabin in West Virginia as an escape.  That it's January, the dead of winter and it's snowing with no signs of letting up is a little disconcerting.  In New York when the doldrums set in she could head out to be around other human beings.  She'll be staying in this cabin for months and being snowed in isn't a thought she relishes.Ross Philips has been Julia's best friend and editor for the past decade and over the past several years discovered that his feelings for her go much deeper.  He's afraid she wouldn't be able to handle his strong sexual appetites so he's kept his attraction to her a secret and dated a bevy of beauties, which Julia refers to as ""The Miss America brigade.""  Since the death of Duke, she's stopped writing and sunk into a depression which entices Ross to tempt her into making some major changes in her life and hopefully a big part of those changes will involve the two of them and tangled sheets.Julia thinks she'll be at the cabin all alone until Ross arrives bringing supplies and a few other odds and ends. While she's certainly happy to see him the reason for his arrival isn't at all clear.  She's not really buying that he came out there concerned for her well being because of the snowstorm but what other possible reason could he have?  It's not until he questions her about her ideals for her erotic book that things take a shocking turn.  Ross volunteers to help her with her erotic research and he's fully prepared to introduce her to all sorts of wickedly exciting ideas.  Julia isn't at all convinced that he'd truly want her - more than likely she's just convenient - but Ross isn't going to give up and being snowed in with him will allow them time to get to know each other much, much better.  What will happen when their time together at the cabin comes to an end though?EROTIC RESEARCH is Mari Carr's first published work and I must say she delivers a delightfully satisfying read.  I found it very easy to empathize with Julia and her self preservation by hiding away from the world.  Ross is a wonderfully caring man who has spent the past decade getting to know Julia and treasures their friendship - even while knowing that he desires much more from her.  Ms. Carr doesn't skimp on any of the research `techniques' and I must say Julia is a very willing subject. This is a delightful read that combines plenty of red hot sex, emotional angst, some soul searching and best of all a lasting love that develops from a genuine friendship.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","02 21, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

1418,B0016IXMCI,"[3, 3]",2,"From what I understand, this is Mari Carr's first published piece and frankly, it kind of reads that way. I liked the two main characters and enjoyed their connection, plus there were some places with decent chemistry and sizzle. Overall though, it all felt very inconsistent. At some points Ross seems very alpha, at others we're told he's alpha but really see no evidence of that.The beginning of their sexual relationship felt a little awkward, with them running hot and cold and bouncing around back and forth on what they understand their relationship to be. The whole thing felt choppy, the love scenes short, jumping from one to another, then skipping a few days, etc. There were only a few lines in each scene that started to make me feel hot and bothered, and then it would sizzle away. It sometimes seemed like the ingredients were there, but for some reason they didn't come together as they should and it ended up feeling ... flat.One *HUGE* complaint I have: They start off almost at the beginning with role-playing - and role-playing in which Julia is a captive or sex slave, i.e. she's supposed to be somewhat resisting. While resistance is not a big part of the role-playing, it's still present, so I found it extremely disturbing that there was no safe word and they didn't lay down any rules or understandings beforehand.As I said before, I liked Julia and Ross and really enjoyed their friendship and the dialogue back-and-forth between them. I think the story could have turned out far better if that part had been more heavily explored and the sexual component of their relationship slowly integrated in. A really fantastic example of this that I read recently was Claire Matthews'Intimate Friends. That novella is even shorter, so the length constraint is greater and they start sleeping together pretty early on, however it felt much smoother and worked far better than in this case.ROMANCE NOVELLA RECOMMENDATIONS:*Intimate Friendsby Claire Matthews (4.5 stars)*Hearts In Darknessby Laura Kaye (4.5 stars)*Willing Victimby Cara McKenna (4 stars)","08 19, 2011",A2AEGAEODIRX75,J.

Fortunately, she's not a weepy, woe-is-me kind of girl.  It's obvious that she's scared and just when it seems that her situation can't be much worse, she becomes the focus of a disagreement amongst the gang.Cal Riker was horrified when he saw Norton pull the beautiful woman from the train.  He may be running with the gang of outlaws but he isn't truly one of them.  Rather than let them take turns raping her, Cal offers his share of the profits in exchange for her.  If there's any hope of his saving her from their lecherous intents then he'll have to make them believe he wants her all to himself.Laurel's shocked to learn that Cal is the legendary killer she's heard so much about but his actions aren't what she'd expect of a ruthless man.  It would have been simple for him to take advantage of her but instead he protects her and insists that he'll deliver her safely to her family.Laurel quickly realizes that she's extremely attracted to Cal and for the first time in her life she's willing to put her heart on the line. Cal tries to play a tough-as-nails outlaw but there's a softer side to him.  They spend a lot of time alone together after leaving the gang and neither of them regrets it when they become lovers.  Cal assumes that their time together will come to an end when she returns home.  Laurel has other ideas.  She's determined to make a life with him and with her family's influence she's sure that it's a possibility.  Is there any hope that he can escape his past and become the model citizen she's sure he can be?Emma Wildes tells awesome historical tales and this story is a prime example of why she's an author on my auto buy list.

Laurel is a spunky character who's found herself in a difficult situation that would have reduced most women to tearful begging.  Cal is an honorable man who does what he believes is right - and it's cost him the sort of life that he should have lived.

""Babylonian Laws,"" which most of us were (I am not sure if this is still the case) exposed to in Junior High, or at the very latest, in High School, are of course more popularly known as ""The Code of Hammurabi"" and are the oldest known (I stress ""known"") laws we presently have access to.This copy, which was published in or around 1903 by C.H.W. Johns (1857 - 1920) contains all the know elements of this code.  Some of the material here is rather fragmented and much has been lost down through the ages.  After all, this work was created around B.C. 2285 - 2242.In this particular work we are given a very nice forward by C.H.W. Johns who was an Assyriologist and Church of England Clergyman.  Johns has quite a number of academic papers under his belt, this being one of them.After the introduction the actual code, or what we know if it, is recorded in all of its known sections.  I personally found this to be an interesting read.  I must admit to having never read the Code in its entirety before and this gave me a golden opportunity to do so.The reader will find that almost all aspects of society at that time were covered.  Quite a number of the situations found during those times no longer exists, but on the other hand many do and for me it is interesting to note that mankind has not changed all that much down through the ages.It is of particular note the various punishments required for infractions of many of these laws.  I covered the first 15 or so pages and I fear to tell you that had I lived at that time my life would have been rather short due to the fact that the death penalty seemed to be the main form of punishment...with drowning and burning being at the top of the list as to methodology.These laws, while quite primitive in our eyes, covered trade, marriage,  slave ownership, concubine management, farming, trade, social interaction and on and on.This is not a good forum to discuss all of these laws item by item as a large number of volumes have been published down through the years addressing this code and most have easy access to these works - if of course, there is interest.For those that are familiar with our current laws (those that possess a far greater understanding than I care to have) will be fascinated as to how this Code has influenced the laws of various societies down through the years.This, as I said, is a free down load and it is a most worthwhile download.  This is a part of our history ergo, we all need to be at least somewhat familiar with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks","03 23, 2012",A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,D.

Numerous specific crimes are mentioned, along with very specific punishments. Most of the crimes revolve around things dealing with farming, buying and selling things, and debts.Punishments ranged from paying a fine (in money or goods/animals), to somewhat much more severe, like having a hand cut off, all the way to death. Some of the things I found most interesting are as follows:Threaten a witness? You die.Judge makes a mistake in giving the penality? Out of a job.Steal. Depends who you steal from. If you're rich, you pay 30 times the amount stolen; if poor, you pay ten times the amount stolen. The laws seemed to be fairly balanced in this way, the penalty in money or goods higher for the rich person than for a poor person.If a woman opens a wine house? She dies.If a wife has sex with some other guy and is caught, they are tied together and drowned.If a wife is very ill, the guy can take another wife but must still take care of the first one.If a son has sex with his mother and they are caught, both are burnred to death.If a son strikes a father, one of his hands is cut off.If a guy causes another guy to lose an eye or break a limb, the same will be done to him.If a guy hits a pregnant woman and she dies, thus losing the baby, then, if the guy has a daughter, she dies.There's also a whole section on the fees various people can charge, including doctors, vets, house builders and ship builders.All-in-all a very harsh system of laws, but in some ways, especially the rich paying a much stiffer penalty than the poor, most fair than today's laws.","08 2, 2013",A1NDYD4JKKY9LE,"Sarah Marie ""sarah_marie""",Harsh laws but some fair points,1375401600

At the age of 19, she has given up any real hope of happiness for herself, but not for Emily. When events on the wagon train leave the 2 girls alone and penniless, Sarah finds herself in a very precarious situation.Roy strikes gold when he arranges for Sarah to be Cal's birthday present. Roy's brother Cal is a decent man who has not found personal happiness and after initial reluctance finds himself drawn to Sarah. She gives him a joy that he no longer anticipated in his life and he gives her a sense of belonging and importance that she did not dare hope for.There are many sweet moments, also involving Roy and little Emily, the mother of the 2 brothers who is confined to a wheelchair after a stroke and a romance between Ned and the schoolteacher.Several malicious, cruel and scheming characters keep the drama moving through to the end.The language was a bit clich&eacute;d in places, but the characters are very likeable and the plot maintains its pace throughout.I will definitely read the next two books in this series.Untamed Hearts (Easton Hearts Series #2)Undaunted Hearts (Easton Hearts Series #3)","03 22, 2011",A1Y6G4Y3P8AQZC,LaylaReader,Western romance,1300752000

And like several of the books in this series, the style is a little more serious than most of her other stuff I've read.It was a good story, but not a traditional romance. The heroine survived a horrid childhood by becoming a tough a**. This isn't just talk, a character description that really has no bearing on the boy-meets-girl plot. She lives the life: collects martial arts black belts, participates in war games, only has one female friend, etc. She also has a series of jobs (that we only hear about, don't really see) that can be dangerous, even violent. Her initial interest in the hero is because he is better than she is at fighting, and she wants him to teach her.There was just one thing that bothered me. From the start, the hero recognized that he had to keep the heroine off balance to hold her attention. So, all their interactions for most of the book were studied on his part. In one scene, for instance, he doesn't compliment her on her appearance when first he sees her, because she would be expecting it. He does so later in the evening, when it's a surprise. This might seem minor, but how honest is he in their getting to know each other, when all his actions and conversation are geared to unsettling her?It's different, but well done.","07 4, 2011",AGTF8KS70RHCW,Terracotta Dove,"Good Read, Different Flavor",1309737600

He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries.

1491,B0017Y914Y,"[53, 53]",5,"I was born not long after the end of World War II.  Some of my earliest memories are of hiding under the table out on my Grandma's porch listening to my Dad and all of my uncles talk about their experiences during the war.  World War II, and in particular the Holocaust, has always held a fascination (for want of a better word) for me. I've read countless books on the subject, watched dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours of movies and documentaries, and even had a chance to see & hear about some of what happened first hand both here at home and living in Germany.In general, I do not approve of fiction when it comes to the Holocaust.  Let me tell you why.  This is an event that must never be forgotten, an event that some (all too many) deny ever happened, even with many survivors and combatants on both sides still alive. So, when I hear about something like ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", first presented as a real event, then later declared to be a complete fiction by the authors themselves, I cringe.  It will not be long before all of the direct witnesses have passed.  Even my generation, the ones who heard the stories first hand, who saw the tattoos, who have walked the remnants of the battlegrounds, are getting on up there. Before too long, there will be nothing to witness except words written in a book.  Those words must be truth, not fantasy.  Otherwise, in 25 or 30 or 40 years people can simply point to a stack of made up books and say ""see - all fiction - never happened.""There are some cases, though, where a story is important to tell even if it must be told through the medium of fiction because there are no longer living witnesses - or perhaps never were.  One of those stories is the roundup,subsequent abandonment and final shipment to Auschwitz of more than 4,000 children in the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris, an action carried out by the French police on Petain's orders.  There were few survivors - a mere handful - and most of those were young children at the time.  Tatiana de Rosney does an excellent job of telling the story of this horrific event inSarah's Key.Until very recently even the fact that there WERE Jewish partisans was not particularly well known, at least not in popular mediums.  Leon Uris talks about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inExodus.  Rudi Weiss joins the Jewish partisans inHolocaust.  Only in the last few years has the story of the Bielski Brothers -The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 JewsandDefiance- truly documented the Jewish Resistance.  As heroic as the Bielskis were, their group was not the only Jewish resistance group. It is vitally important that a couple of decades from now, when all who were there to witness or spoke to those who witnessed are gone, that people know that everyone did not march quietly to the slaughter like so many sheep, that the Bielskis were neither alone in their resistance nor an aberration. There is room in the historical record forThe Remnant - Stories of the Jewish Resistance in WWII.Othniel Seiden's story has its foundations in a great deal of research - interviews, records of the Nuremberg proceedings, diaries left behind by those who lived these events - and he has done a remarkable job of presenting characters that are accurate & compelling composites.Some have commented negatively on his portrayal of the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Hitler's Final Solution, particularly as regards the Pope in office at the time of World War II, a role that has been the subject of great debate over the years, debate that is not yet entirely settled.  The basic facts that Seiden addresses in this regard - that the Catholic Church had a pact with Hitler and that the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Europe at the end of World War II - are grounded in known, demonstrable facts.  It is only since the papacy of Pope John Paul II, himself a Polish seminary student during World War II, that there has been some attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of Pope Pius XII regarding his actions towards the Nazis and the ""Final Solution."" Had Seiden chosen to present this rehabilitative material, information that would have been unknown to the characters at the time during which these events occurred, would be to rewrite history.  That would be a grave error.Highly recommended.  This is worth your time to read.","02 6, 2012",A2WZNM833CJH82,Grandma,Worth your time to read!,1328486400

I expect to feel disgust, anger and sadness when reading accounts of the Holocaust-what I didn't expect was how this book made me examine myself, and analyze what I believe in my heart...I am struggling to put into words what I am feeling, but I will try...Sol makes the point when talking to the priest that Christians have been taught from birth that the only way is through Christ, and they are all anti-Semitic, even if sub-consciously... I consider myself a Christian, but was not raised in any particular ""religion""- as a result, I only have the Bible to go on, where it is repeatedly said that the Jews are Gods Chosen people... I can't imagine that has changed. God is not fickle. Is God going to refuse the Jewish people, who also love and serve Him? If I thought that were possible than maybe He isn't a God I want to serve...As long as anyone is condemning someone else for having a different belief system than their own, we are doomed to repeat history. There are many paths to God. It makes me cringe when any one religion claims theirs' is the ONLY way. We need to embrace each other, as equal children of God, and remember that the Greatest Commandment is LOVE. Who are we to judge another?I highly recommend this book.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades. What should have been a day or two read, turned into almost a week because I had to keep stopping and looking things up; I have over two pages of notes on events and people and rumors that I had to chase down. And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it.

She doesn't get very far and when she's caught by Luke and Gabe, Jules is taken to their home and claimed.  The mating will come later once she accepts her position.  Time is not on their side, however, because Luke and Gabe aren't the only lions wanting Jules.  Now they must accept a mating challenge with the hope that they will be the victors.Claiming Their Mate was a great book!  I loved how Luke and Gabe could sense Jules' thoughts and feelings and did their best to make her comfortable in her new home.  Jules' temperament often seemed off to me--I wanted her to care for the brothers as much as I could tell they cared for her. But, despite that, I enjoyed the foray in the White Sands Pride of lions.  Claiming Their Mate was sensual and highly charged.  It was a well written m&eacute;nage that was almost innocent in its sensuality because of the lack of a certain sexual position shown in most m&eacute;nage stories.  The ending was sublime, although it seemed a bit cut off because I would have loved to have seen Luke, Jules, and Gabe at home in their own bed loving each other.  However, that wasn't enough to keep me from reading another book by Paige McKellan.  She is on my radar now, and I can't wait to read more of her work!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","05 16, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Claiming Their Mate,1210896000

Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: This little book  is #1 of the paranormal romance/erotica series ""Cougar Falls"" that features a variety of shifters. There is really only one thing that will influence how much you will enjoy this book- assuming you generally enjoy this genre in the first place: Would you find a m&eacute;nage encounter between one sexy lady and three hot brothers erotic? That is the only question to ask yourself. If you find your curiosity piqued or you KNOW you would, then read this. If not, then move on to something else.Reading order in the series:Rachel's TotemIn Plain SightFoxy LadyCHARACTERS: All these characters are sweet and sexy. It's a quirky little town with quirky people. This is a FAST read, so not a lot of development. I was actually surprised at how well the entire town was depicted in such a short book. While no one was fully developed, I got a good sense of the character of the place.PLOT: Again, this is a novella in a genre known for keeping things simple. Not a big plot line here- but for what it is, it's well done. It is definitely more creative than most I've read and opens up a world of possibilities for future books. All told, brilliant execution through simplicity.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended if you are up for some erotically messy f/m/m/m- no BSDM or m/m.

(Novella sized).- m/f with a 1f:3m experience. Explicit, sometimes Dominant (authoritative). No m/m (brothers).

In ""Rachel's Totem"" our Heroes are catamount (puma) shifters, but we meet a raptor, a bear, some foxes, and some wolves. The humans are expected to take on some of their animals traits (the foxes are ""sly"", for example), and so the shifting aspects become integral to the story line. It's an interesting take on the Shifter World, and set up well in this first novella of the series.""Rachel's Totem"" as a whole is a good book. It's solid. The erotic scenes are heated, including a menage required to bring her animal to the fore, but they perhaps aren't as well-developed as others of the genre. What it has going for it is an interesting World Premise. A Small Shifter Town with Bad Wolves on the horizon and Native American Magic playing a bass line. How these sub-plots will play out in future books is yet to be seen, but right now it gives the series Promise.3.5 stars rounded up. It needed more character depth, and I'm not convinced on the menage scenes.

Characters are not very deep, but still appealing. Magic is understated with the emphasis on the dual nature of the shifters and the significance of finding a mate. This is a fast read- what you see is what you get. Nothing too intense.PLOT: Very basic. This is a subgenre that traditionally doesn't have complicated plotlines and this one doesn't stray far from the norm. Still, it does what it is supposed to. This is a NOVELLA, so be prepared for things to move a little faster than is reasonable. There isn't much adjustment time for Max to court Emma, Emma to accept the idea of shifters and becoming one and the plot to resolve itself. It would have been better if there was more to it. One complaint, the ""claiming"" was completely unreasonable in its suddenness and lack of explanation- and then the response was disproportionately low.CHARACTERS: Like watching an episode of ""Friends,"" this story presents a few fun personalities with a little history and plenty of potential for ongoing mischief. Max seems like a genuinely nice, well rounded guy, if a little self-centered. Emma is a spunky, full-figured chick. Her virgin state was a little too far-fetched for me and, frankly, I'm getting a little annoyed with the prevalence of this particular point in para-romance. Maybe there are more virgins out there than I thought...BOTTOM LINE: This is perfect if you are in the mood for a little shifter fun.

Very little reaction was shown to something that was really a pretty big life altering discovery. They didn't seem to care that these guys turned them into werecats.

1557,B001892DGG,"[0, 0]",5,"Originally posted at: [...]If you enjoy paranormal romances with funny quips, sassy mates and well developed characters then The Wallflower will be a treat.Emma is a hot ticket. Maybe she used to be a wallflower in high school but those days are long behind her. Well, they should be but there's this one babe who is a thorn in her side. I found Emma's response to the witch as one I could respect and very classy. She now gives as good as she gets and I enjoyed every minute of it. Some people are inherently nasty and never seem to grow up, so the secondary character that plagues Emma is a great personality to showcase the inner strength that Emma now has.And the part where she was snarling at Max, the way that whole scene was written had me grinning ear to ear. I could visualize it in my head and I would adore seeing that on the big screen. Even at her most grouchy, it was still romantic.Max is the alpha and a very interesting man. Ms. Bell's choice of scene for Max's introduction to Emma was classic and quite fun. It had a real presence to it, a fullness that resonated with me and hooked me.He's a classic kind of character, full of take charge genes that demand capitulation from those he is in charge of. When Emma stands up to him, the resulting reaction is everything I could wish in a man who becomes besotted with his future mate, and the hunt is on. What fun. I loved Max's strength, and so did Emma.One of the main things that hooked me about this story was the dialogue. When Emma called Max `Captain Caveman', it gave me the giggles. She has all these cute references to kitty litter and jokes about shifters in general that it gave me a good feeling about Emma's persona. She's a character that I'd like to know for real. Max's reaction to some of what she says is equally fun and enjoyable to read. He takes his role as alpha seriously but he knows how to have a good time as well, and his sense of humor compliments Emma. Ms. Bell must have a delightful sense of humor of her own, because this story is warm and loving even when the tension is high.The sensual and sexual tension is wonderfully built up and delivered. I have said it before in my reviews of paranormal romances and I'll say it again - I adore a good bite scene and this tale delivered splendidly. It was erotic, titillating and very satisfying. Another thing I appreciated was Ms. Bell's handling of Emma's reaction to the big revelation. This story was so well balanced, it made me feel good during and after my reading of it.The secondary characters each play a vital role in helping a reader understand the main personalities in the tale, or they contributed to the plot movement. Everyone was there for a reason and it was believable. The story is told in both Max's and Emma's points of view with a perfect balance to keep me interested and involved. The conflict is mostly external but it tweaked a few internal issues as well. I think this book was written with a fine balance between an involved and fleshed out storyline and the amount of sexual escapades between the hero and heroine. It satisfied my mind and my libido.The Wallflower is a book not to miss for readers who are looking for a hero and heroine who can make them smile, sigh and outright laugh. It's a vibrant and rich world of likeable characters and an interesting courtship between a hunky eye doctor and an adorably sassy shop owner. I had so much fun reading this book that I simply have to find more by Ms. Bell. Her writing is becoming an addiction I can't wait to indulge more in. I absolutely recommend reading this impish and delightfully saucy book.","09 10, 2010",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...",One for the Keeper Shelf,1284076800

At times the men even talked like girls. There was a part in the story when Emma called Max(the hero) a girl and agreed.So other than the high school drama kind of feel and the men sounding more like women at times (ex. one of the male characters described a pushy female as a 'stanky ho'), I liked the story.

1585,B001892DIO,"[2, 2]",2,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 4/10PROS:- The story is filled with glamorous surroundings and people who are fun to read about. Who's not interested, on at least some level, in famous twin brothers who make People's 50 Most Beautiful People list, frequent A-list clubs, and stay in the executive suites of fancy hotels?- I liked Kasey's brother, Garrett, quite a bit. He's flashy and flamboyant with a ""devil take it"" attitude, yet he also knows when to be serious and is very protective of his twin.- Gram has a pretty serious thing for Kasey from the start of the story, and I thought it was cute that although Gram thinks he has hidden his attraction so well, so many of his employees and friends know about it and encourage it.CONS:- I couldn't help rolling my eyes at some of the melodramatic--and unrealistic--things the characters do. Kasey, who's not out in public, wakes up on the couch of a night club and immediately twines his fingers with Gram's...then lets Gram kiss him? Gram starts calling Kasey ""baby"" after their first sexual encounter? Kasey gives an impassioned coming out speech to a whole slew of reporters not 20 minutes after having said he wasn't going to tell anyone outright?- There's practically no buildup, emotional or physical, to the first sex scene, and because there's so little development between sex scenes, they left me cold. They're lovingly described in rather minute detail, but I found them a little clinical. They have a removed, play-by-play feel to them.- Some of the dialogue is wooden-sounding and is used to awkwardly convey plot points that would have been better placed in the exposition. For example, Kasey says this while talking to Garrett at the beginning of the story: ""Add to the fact your twin brother is a starting point guard on a pro basketball team and you're a tabloid reporter's wet dream."" There's some important background information here, but it just doesn't sound natural in dialogue.- There are numerous ""duh"" instances throughout the story where the writing needlessly repeats itself. Here's one: ""Kasey weighed in at around two hundred pounds. At one hundred and eighty pounds, Garrett was several pounds lighter.""Overall comments: I like the idea of this story: the setting is alluring, and there are several interesting minor characters with dramatic comings and goings that read rather like a soap opera. However, the story very much focuses on the sex scenes; and since I didn't find them particularly titillating, the entire novella fell flat for me.","08 5, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T.

1587,B001892DIO,"[1, 1]",5,"One thing you could say of T.A. Chase's books is that they are all very different. This one is a sexual romp (from Merriam Webster Online romp = a: high-spirited, carefree, and boisterous play b: something suggestive of such play: as (1): a light fast-paced narrative, dramatic, or musical work usually in a comic mood (2): an episode of lovemaking).Kasey is a 23 years old pro basketball player. He is only in his second year as professional player and he has no courage to openly admit that he is gay. He is out with his family and friends, but not with the public opinion. Plus his twin brother Garrett, a famous actor, has made coming out some years ago and now all media are only waiting for him to make the same claim.But Kasey till now has never had a boyfriend to care and he doesn't see the reason to suffer all the harrassment he will receive in the locker room if he makes that claim. That is, but now in Kasey's life enters Gram, a night club owner and an openly gay man who had bad experiences in the past with closeted lovers.Kasey must decide if he is willing to risk his career to keep his lover by his side.The story is not very long, less than 90 pages, but it's very erotic. From the first time Kasey and Gram have a very intense relationship and they are driven by lust most of the time. Since Kasey is a 23 years old guy that for sometime was deprived of a sexual partner, I think it's not strange that now that he can have someone near him, he is in frenzy to make up for the lost time. Plus it was a true discovery that Kasey is a totally bottom. I'm used to sports characters to be always very manly, even if gay, and usually they are totally top. Instead Kasey wants to be mastered, even if he is a pushy bottom.The main characters don't interact a lot with the supporting characters, but there are some interesting figures: Garrett, Kasey's brother, Paul, Kasey's teammate, but also Bo, Gram's employee and Colville, another pro basketball player. Since this is the first book in a series, I think we will have the chance to read something on one or plus of these characters.","04 25, 2008",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Out of Bounds (Love of Sports 1) by T.A.

Both are gay, Garrett is out but Kasey isn't. As the story opens, Kasey is back from an out-of-town game, and Garrett wants him to go out to a local club with him - Garrett has just broken up with his long-term partner and wants to go have fun.Ingram (Gram) Fletcher owns the Liverpool, the club near Kasey's home. Gram has had his eye on Kasey forever, but doesn't know if Kasey is straight or gay so he hasn't made a move. When Garrett and Kasey get to the club, one of their friends casually mentions to Gram that Kasey's in the back of the club and hints that Kasey might not rebuff advances from Gram. Then Garrett hints at the same thing. Deciding to take a chance, he heads over to see Kasey, and makes his move...and is rewarded with an enthusiastic response from Kasey.Kasey and Gram decide to get together again, and begin dating. Since Kasey is ""in"" and Gram is ""out"", it does make things a bit difficult. Kasey can't afford a hint of of the truth getting out as the sports world is nowhere near as accepting as Hollywood is, and rumors already swirl about Kasey's sexuality due to his twin being openly gay.When Kasey and Grant get together for a weekend in New Orleans, things don't go as planned and Kasey has to take a stand...My thoughts: First of all, you know I'm a sucker for any book that takes place in part or whole in New Orleans :) I really did enjoy Out of Bounds though. Kasey was a sympathetic character (I seem to always sympathize with the ones in the closet, I guess, lol) and Gram was understanding of his situation. I find in a lot of the M/M stories the partner that is openly gay gets frustrated with the partner that is not; that Gram wasn't pushing Kasey was a refreshing change.I had a bit of trouble with the opening scene - Kasey is very closeted and when Gram approached him in the club they started making out in public. I found that hard to believe, even if they were in the back of the VIP area. Except for that scene, though, I thought TA Chase did a great job with describing the setting and characters, and I could picture the events unfolding in my mind as I read along. Kasey's homophobic teammates were hateful and I was glad he also had supportive teammates in the locker room.I'm looking forward to reading his brother Garrett's story next - High Line.","04 1, 2011",A76OB6E2II5KS,"Loves FAB Romance ""Introvert, Worrier,  & res...",Out of Bounds,1301616000

It was a promise that wasn't really fulfilled.After that there's a lot of sex and the plot (young sport star who has to decide whether to stay in the closet and keep his endorsements or to come out and face the consequences with his teammates and fans) is lost in the bedroom. We don't really know the two characters and especially Gram is rather flat.There are no real problems in the book and it is a fast and hot read, but it seems incomplete and rushed at the end, like a collection of little episodes, but nothing really tying them together.","01 25, 2011",A1RXR105ND8OSH,manutwo,An unfulfilled promise,1295913600

She couldn't believe her husbands (yes plural) Logan Wellesly and Rhys Cullen had stood her up again.  The night she was going to share the news that they were going to be parents.  To make matters worse when they did call, instead of apologizing for standing her up, they were canceling the 2 week vacation they had planned.  She was tired of pretending that their marriage wasn't a mess; she thought this vacation was their last chance to get it back on track - and they canceled.  So she was going without them...she figured they wouldn't even notice that she was gone.Two days after she arrived in Jamaica, Rhys finds her dancing in a club.  He takes her back to his hotel room, where a few minutes later Logan shows up, and he seems surprised that she left without a note or phone call.  They proceed to make it up to her - then business gets in the way again.  They run off again...she returns home, where they are going to meet her and surprise...surprise they had a change of plans.They should have put as much effort into their marriage as they did in trying to get the hotel contract.  I suppose it has a HEA.I have to say I felt bad for Catherine through the entire story.  I also have to say that Logan and Rhys are a couple of Ba****ds.

Her husbands have been taking her for granted and over the past several months have blown off every date she's set up.  She wholeheartedly loves them but nurturing their relationship has fallen by the wayside in their course to better their business.  It's their five year anniversary and she has some very exciting news but their neglect has her questioning if she should stay or kiss them goodbye.Logan and Rhys have invested a year's worth of time in securing the biggest contract of their business career.  Unfortunately the client keeps jerking them around.  In their determination to make more money they've lost sight of what's truly important - their unique relationship with Cat.  They soon realize that their drive for success could quite possibly cost them the love of their lives.It's been three months since Cat was last intimate with Logan and Rhys.  They've been too wrapped up in their business ventures to pay her much attention and she's sunk into a pit of despair and loneliness.  The men completely forgot about their anniversary dinner and then canceling out on their Jamaican vacation is just too much.  She's played second best for far too long.  Cat has every intention of going on this vacation - with or without them.  It will give her a chance to relax and reevaluate her situation.  What she doesn't expect is for her unexpected absence from their home to open Logan and Rhys eyes to the possibility of a life without her.  Logan and Rhys have made a success of their business but their marriage is on the verge of failure.  Will they find a way to balance the two or is it already too late to rectify the wrongs they've done to Cat?If you think being in a menage a trois relationship means that you'd never feel neglected or taken for granted then you're wrong.  In Maya Banks STAY WITH ME, Cat, Logan and Rhys are forced to face the fact they're all to blame for the break down in their marriage.  Cat's been too compliant and never voiced her unhappiness.  Logan and Rhys are so career driven that they didn't realize that they were hurting her by not being more attentive.  If their marriage is going to succeed they're all going to have to put each other first, but can the men really delegate their business to office hours only?Maya Banks has become one of my favorite authors because of her emotionally driven storylines.  In STAY WITH ME readers will be drawn into the story and come to really care about the characters and maybe even live vicariously through them.  Who wouldn't like to have two sexy men doing everything in their power to make sure you don't leave them?

Instead of coming in on the part of the couple's story when their relationship was just starting we come in on the middle where it's on the verge of ending.I'm beginning to wonder if maybe I expect too much from my taboo or erotic reads.  For a romance I expect likable characters for the leads, characters that even if I don't agree with what they do that at the least I'll understand why. Both of those factors were missing in this book.  Logan the alpha male in the threesome was all alpha and not at all likable.  Usually I am the first one to jump up and root for an alpha male, but in this case there were very few redeemable qualities to be found in Logan.  As a reader you understand Catherine loves him, but why?  Rhys was better than Logan in that at least he was likable, but that was it.  There was nothing wonderful about him.To me the story would have been better if Catherine had stuck to her resolve even once,  made them really work for something. It just seemed that at every turn Catherine was giving in and going along with what they wanted.  In the end I found myself  just skimming the last few chapters. I'd recommend skipping this one.Stats:Ebook pages: 118 of actually storyGenre:  erotic, menage romanceRe-Readablitiy: NoneSteam Factor: Hot","03 4, 2012",A1CW6U1Y2PGVWS,"C.

I was looking forward to this book mainly because I usually love Maya Banks's style. But I found myself having to push through parts of the story. The plot sounded good, different, and it was. However, there was no real angst. The story, by design, starts out in the middle of the relationship. She does explain what led up to this point, however, the men never show their &#34;alpha-ness&#34; in any true sense and she just capitulates to them way to easily. None of them seem to have any friends or family as well. If she was so unhappy and lonely, why didn't she talk to them? Why is it only the three of them? The only other character mentioned is the men's personal assistant who seems to be on her side. But she doesn't confide in her either. Also, it is mentioned in the very beginning that one of the characters may not be happy with the arrangement and that line is quickly dropped, never to be mentioned again. I normally would highly recommend anything by this author but I don't feel I can with this one.

She couldn't take it anymore.  On what should be the happiest night of her life, her life was falling apart.  Catherine was going to have a baby, and now wasn't sure that she would have anyone to fill the father role.  She had planned a vacation for all of them, and now Rhys and Logan wouldn't even be there.  Everything was more important than she was.  She didn't even rank anymore.  So sure it was over, Catherine decided to go on the vacation to Jamaica alone to figure out what her next step was now that she was on her own.Rhys and Logan were panicked when they arrived home to find Catherine gone.  She had been gone for days, and they hadn't even known.  Figuring she went on vacation without them, they headed for Jamaica to get their woman back.  When they arrived, they couldn't believe how distant and withdrawn she was.  Rhys and Logan knew how abominably they had treated her not just recently, but for years.  That sad fact had become abundantly clear, and there was no one to blame except themselves.  Catherine had always been there loving them, and they were no longer sure she would stay with them.  Rhys and Logan had a lot of hurt to make up for, and would stop at nothing to convince Catherine she would always come first.MB has done it again!

After being married for five years, Catherine and her men are finally going to be parents.  She can only imagine how happy they will be, and the anniversary vacation the trio has planned to leave for the next day will be the icing on the cake. The longer Catherine waits, however, the more she realizes she has been stood up once again for business. She soul searches and comes up with the only conclusion she can think of, and so heads out on her anniversary vacation alone.Logan and Rhys love Catherine, their wife, more than they ever thought possible.  Striving to make their business successful so she would want for nothing has been tough, and they've had to make a lot of sacrifices, especially where their marriage is concerned.  When a client unexpectedly requires their presence in another town, Logan and Rhys don't hesitate. They leave immediately, completely forgetting their dinner date with their wife.  Upon their return, Logan and Rhys immediately sense something is wrong.  It seems their home is empty, and their wife has left without them.Catherine has to do a lot of soul searching.  She loves her men unconditionally, but she is so very tired of being taken advantage of.  She knows she is more important than just a phone call, and so makes the decision to stand strong where her husbands are concerned.

With every novel she releases, Stay with Me included, I find myself swept away in a story and plot line so gripping that I can't stop reading. Stay with Me could be about any wife who's taken advantage of and for granted.  When Catherine put her foot down concerning her feelings, I applauded her for being a strong woman.

At least they still had their upcoming two week vacation to Jamaica where they would have some much needed time uninterrupted. When Logan and Rhys postpone that to jet off on a last minute business trip, Catherine has to face the facts that her marriage is in serious trouble. Desperate for some time to think, she decides to go on that vacation without (telling) them. When Logan and Rhys return home to find her gone, they realize they're on the verge of losing the woman they love. Not willing to let her go without a fight, they chase after her and spend the next two weeks trying to gain her forgiveness as well as her trust.This story was an emotional roller coaster ride fro beginning to end. At first it was easy to side with Catherine. She's felt neglected for a long time, more so since Logan and Rhys began building their company from the ground up. Then we get glimpses into the minds of Logan and Rhys, and it becomes apparent that they love Cat beyond measure. They're not bad, just oblivious. When they finally catch up with her, they don't waste any time trying to convince her she's still their number one priority. However actions speak louder than words, and act they do.Catherine accepts responsibility that she's partly to blame for the breakdown of their marriage because she never told them how she really felt whenever they put the company before her. I liked that Logan and Rhys acknowledged that they'd messed up. They didn't try to dictate her around or make her feel guilty. However, after we find out about their background and that their quest to be financially successful was as much for her as it was for them, it made Cat seem clingy, needy and selfish (but it could have been her pregnancy hormones adding fuel to the fire). Despite being on vacation with her, they still had a company to run, and they left without leaving instructions behind, so it really bothered me that she would tense up and get angry or fearful whenever they'd take a work call or work email. Before things get better, there's a misunderstanding and more drama for them to overcome. In the end I think they redeemed themselves by making compromises that seemed so simple. If only they had come to that conclusion sooner. Hindsight is 20/20 and I think their relationship only got stronger because of all the heartache.Though the love scenes were steamy, I found myself skimming them. They weren't bad, but I was just more invested in the characters and their personal growth as they tried to navigate the pitfalls of work and marriage.

It seems the guys have been so single-minded in their pursuit of success that they have been neglecting poor Catherine.

The guys are hot and the reader realizes that they work hard for Catherine because the three began their lives together very humbly.

The plan is so secret that his wife Jolene doesn't know anything about it and isn't involved in its realization. However, she has to pick up the bits and pieces of her life, has to get used to the idea of being a widow and has to try to go on with her life.Six years after the death of her husband Jolene is a successful deputy marshal on an elite warrant team but her private life still suffers - she hasn't been involved with any man after her husband's death. Then, all of a sudden, Paul's worst fears seem to come true: an attempt on Jolene's life is made and Paul decides to ""secure"" his wife by taking her to the high security military base he is working. But what thinks Jolene about her husband's ""resurrection""?I would've liked to elaborate more on above summary but was really afraid to spoil too much since the plot was simple and straight forward, without creating any mentionable ups and downs. Except for few pages at the beginning of the novel, the whole book took place in the secret military base. Furthermore, the book didn't have any serious sub-characters, except for two of Jolene's colleagues and one of Paul's, who all made very rare and unmentionable appearances.  That wouldn't really matter if the interaction between the two main characters would've been outstanding and making the change in scenery and characters needless, which really wasn't the case, especially since Paul's  main target was completely one dimensional: he wanted only to get her into his bed and she couldn't resist.The more I read about Paul the less I liked him. By choosing his career he very consciously made the decision to lead a solitarily and withdrawn life, gaining in return for this sacrifice self-fulfillment through his academic achievements. Basically he made the very active decision to barter his private life for his professional life. So far so good, until he decides to marry Jolene against his better knowledge and for one reason only: he wants to get her into his bed.  As if this wasn't selfish enough, he decides to ""reappear"" after six years, without taking his wife's career and private life into consideration. This is no alpha male but just a stupid egoist!This isn't the first book I read from this author, however, I was deeply disappointed and very much surprised by the many 5* ratings it got!

Rather than wallow in self pity, Jo used his life insurance to attend a special training program for women interested in law enforcement.  She's made a name for herself and is now in one of the highly sought after positions on the elite warrant squad. The only area of her life where she hasn't moved on is her love life.  Since her husband's death, not once has Jo taken a lover even though she's had plenty of opportunities.As a member of the elite warrant squad Jo's used to facing down bad guys and plenty of injuries but the recent attacks against her are troubling.  Sure the protection team will do their best to protect her but even they are no match for the men who are after her.  Jo realizes that she's pissed off her share of perpetrators but even she's stumped as to who's after her and why.Paul Benate believed that he was doing the right thing when he allowed Jo to believe he'd died.  His position dealing with extremely classified projects makes him a target so he's had to live within the confines of a small base which is extremely difficult to penetrate.  When he learns of the attacks on Jo, he realizes that his sorry attempt at protecting her by letting her go has failed miserably.  The only option acceptable to him is having her brought to him.  The old Jo would have been ecstatic to learn that her husband still lives: the new Jo is beyond furious that Paul allowed her to be deceived for so many years.Jo's worked long hard hours to gain the respect of her team and make a life for herself - without Paul.  So him thinking that he has the right to have her kidnapped and brought to him is simply too much.  She may still love Paul but no way is she going to allow him to dictate her life.Mary Wine tells an amazing tale with STILL MINE!  I loved Jo's kick butt attitude and yet she still has this vulnerability that endears her to readers.  She's a feisty little woman and even Paul is stunned by the changes that have taken place with her over the past six years.  Paul is very much in love with Jo so even though she's furious with him, as a reader I couldn't help but want them to have their happily ever after.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","07 23, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

But Jolene wasnt anyways the tough Deputy Marshal. Six years ago she was a sweet and nieve 20 year old who thought she'd found the man of her dreams and married him. Less than a year later she was a widow and as hard as she's tried she hasnt been able to be with anyone else since. When an attempt is made on her life and she is shot the Marshals put her in protective custody but an elite Army team takes her from there to a secret Army base where everything she thought she knew about her husband and what happened to him is a lie.Turns out her husband isnt dead after all. Paul Benate is one of those freakinly smart men that works soley on Goverment top secret projects. He knew 6 years ago he had no business getting involved with Jolene but he couldnt resist the strange pull she had on him. He decided that she was to innocent and weak to be able to handle what she would have to being his wife and chose to let her believe he died. But now that his worst fear has come to life - a terrorist wanting to kidnap Jolene to get him to coroperate with them - he has no choice but to have her brought to him.The new and improved Jolene doesnt take her husbands deception well.

She was damn good at her job, and everyone knew it.  There was only one thing missing from her existence, and that was a personal life, and love.  Her one true love had been stripped away from her six long years ago, and to this day she still felt the acute pain of losing her husband Paul Benate.  Jo knew she should try to move on; give her heart a push to meet someone new, but she just couldn't do it.Paul wasn't dead as everyone assumed he was.  He had cut Jolene out of his life because he was working on classified projects, and he was terrified that someone would use her to get to him, so he had taken that possibility away.  He did keep tabs on his beautiful wife, and knew she hadn't moved on with someone else just the same as he hadn't.  When he could stand it no longer, he decided to have her brought to the current military complex he was working in.  Someone trying to get to him had shot her, and it was time he started protecting what was his.Jolene was abducted from her protection detail, and was being shipped to someone.  She had no idea what was going on, but decided that keeping a cool head would be her best line of defense.  She had to pay attention, so she could find an opportunity to escape.  Nothing could have shocked her more than coming face to face with the husband she had mourned for years.  She almost lost it, but reigned herself in, and took the only course of action she could at the moment.  Jo resorted to violence, and punched the husband she thought was lost.Paul is a man that was forced to live with a decision he wished with his soul he could change.  He knew he never should have given up his heart's desire in favor of what he wanted to accomplish professionally.  Jolene had existed without Paul for years, but never recovered from his loss.  As these two lost lovers try to rekindle the love, and loss of trust, outside enemies try to separate them forever.  This is a pretty good story, but in several spots it slows to a crawl, and is even boring at times.  Overall it is an interesting read, but not a keeper.","08 7, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Still Mine,1218067200

I wasn't always sure I liked Paul, but I didn't dislike him, so I found myself willing to give him a chance based on Jo's past regard for him. Jo, I loved! She had crawled out from her grief and became an amazingly strong female character, as a deputy marshal, able to hold her own amongst the military world that Paul drug her into. She was no damsel waiting for her knight to save her. I found the mystical attraction between Jo and Paul a bit over the top, but didn't think it detracted from the story too much.

Now she is a deputy marshal on an elite warrant team.  It's not been an easy road and Jo has succeeded, if you don't count the fact she can't move on from the love of her deceased husband.Paul Benate gave up Jo in a move he thought would prevent her from ever being harmed.  Paul has a brain that many would love to control and while he likes working for the military, he missed Jo every day these last six years.  When a report shows that Jo has been found and is a target, Paul demands to get back all he lost.When Jo and Paul meet again, the fireworks are many and pointed.  Jo is hurt and angry that she was lead to believe Paul was dead.  Paul wants to begin again, but first he has to convince Jo to both forgive him and to understand.  Love brought them together and drove them apart. Now when the danger to Jo seems to follow her, will love be enough to give Paul and Jo another chance?Still Mine has several of my favorite aspects in a story: hot sexy scenes, engaging main characters, and enough suspense that it makes you want to read quickly to find out the ending.  Jo has grown up and found a career even while loving the husband she believes is dead.  Paul made a decision he thought would save Jo from danger and was given a second chance.  From the moment they met face-to-face, I was drawn in and could not flip the pages fast enough.  Even before giving in to their passion, I could feel the strength of it.  I was quickly reminded that the emotions that give passion can produce equal fear and anger.  Watching Jo and Paul try and work out the past to hopefully lead to a new future for them showed me that a true and deep love never really dies.  When the danger comes from an unexpected angle, at least for me, I loved seeing the depth of the trust that had been restored between Paul and Jo.  Still Mine is equal parts hot romance and suspense, which I found not to be missed.  The cliffhanger ending leads me to hope that just maybe Jo and Paul will show up again soon in another book.Joreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","07 8, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Still Mine,1215475200

She's a woman on a mission and if that means trading in her tomboy look for `skank' clothes complete with thong underwear then so be it.  Over the past year she's watched her boss, Ridge, parade his various dates in front of her, and she's determined to finally be the woman he desires.Ridge Casey has had the hots for Morgan since the day he hired her to work at the architectural firm but since she never showed the slightest interest in him he wasn't about to put a strain on their working relationship. Seeing her sitting at her desk looking like sex personified is almost more than he can handle.  Fortunately Morgan puts him out of his misery and admits that the radical change in her appearance is all for him.Ridge and his business partner Carter are expecting an announcement regarding a bid they'd put in for the design of the Honor Center.  They've lost out on the last two bids they put in so everyone's hopeful that this time is the charm.  As soon as Ridge sees Morgan the bid and anything business oriented takes a backseat to staking his claim on her.  He considers her his woman and seeing her all gussied up brings out the caveman attitude in him - heaven help her if she's dressed like that for some other man.Once he learns that they've wasted a whole year pretending not to want each other, Ridge isn't willing to waste another moment. He certainly isn't going to allow any other man to see her dressed so provocatively.  Like the alpha male he is, he drags her away from the office and takes her to his place where they proceed to cement their relationship.  There's just a little problem that crops up - Malone and Casey have lost out on the bid and this time they know that someone in their business is selling inside information to the competition.  Is it possible the changes in Morgan and her seduction of Ridge are intended to cover up her involvement in sabotaging the company?Annmarie McKenna has quickly garnered many readers attention with her smoldering hot storylines and memorable characters.  Who hasn't been `in love' with the boss, a coworker, or even a teacher?  Morgan's shy boldness really struck a cord with me.  She's got an air of innocent hopefulness while still maintaining a confident air.  Ridge is wonderfully alpha while still being vulnerable.  I was charmed by his insecurity where Morgan's concerned.  I'd love to see a follow up story for Carter - possibly with a hook up with the office `witch' Amy Lee.  I admit it I really didn't like her but I could easily imagine Carter taking command of her - in a very good way.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","09 6, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

When he gets into the office, two things give his stomach a punch.  The first is Morgan and her new outfit and just how many of the other men at the firm have seen her in it, and the second is that they were somehow outbid again.Ridge has no choice but to deal with Morgan and her sexy outfit since his pants are beginning to not feel so comfortable.

1731,B00189ZCY6,"[16, 16]",3,"First of all, let me preface my review by letting you know up front that I don't consider A MATTER OF NECESSITY to be a romance.  It is a fictional FBI crime novel that just happens to feature two men in love.  The crime solving is the central plot, and the romance happens offstage.  Even the sex happens offstage.  In fact, at times it felt like everything in this book happened offstage.  Throughout the entire book I felt like I was reading a summary of a story, not the actual story itself.My problems with this book come from the fact that I never felt as though I was invited inside the story.  It was a very odd feeling.  The author's offstage style is such that I felt like I was reading the Cliffs Notes or watching bits and pieces of the story through a closed window, which was a real shame.  I absolutely adored the characters and I wish I had been allowed to experience their romance and their blossoming relationship first-hand rather than from behind closed doors.  Alex was surprisingly accepting of his love for his best friend and the social consequences that came with admitting he was gay.  Shawn was determined to show Alex how much he loved him and was willing to do anything for Alex's love.  How sweet is that?This is an entertaining book and very worthy of three stars, but I could have easily given it five stars if I'd been invited into the story and allowed to witness the tender romance between Alex and Shawn firsthand.  I recommend this book to fans of M/M cop drama, but romance fans may feel short-changed.","04 29, 2008",AL6WDE46RJ9I3,Amazon Customer,A MATTER OF NECESSITY by T. D. McKinney,1209427200

1733,B00189ZCY6,"[0, 0]",5,"This is a little discovery. I have this book since a bit, but for one reason or the other, I wait to a lot before reading it. And I immediately discovered my mistake cause since the first pages you can understand that this is a great romance, that the fans of the genre will love.Alex is a wasp FBI Special Agent who has fought all his life to avoid the innuendo from friends or colleague about him being gay. Actually he has never desired men, he loves women and finds very attractive all the women are. Only he is also a very uptight middle-classe man, who loves to grew roses, write poems and paint. And since he is also an handsome, but not bulky man, he is always mistaken for a gay man.So when he is undercover with Shawn, a big Australian Special Agent, very manly and handsome, he is totally unprepared when the big guy hits on him, and openly declares his attraction for him and the desire to be his lover... in the submissive position! True, they are undercover as gay lovers, but it's not necessary to play the role when they are alone in their house, but Shawn has no restrain and in the end he manages to involve Alex in an hot relationship. But when their mission ends, what will remain to them? They are teammate and the Agency maybe will be not so happy to have two agents involved in an open gay relationship.I like very much as T.D. McKinney manages to mix romance with reality. True, some scenes are really stretched to the limit of reality (Shawn's woo of Alex), but hey, this is a romance, and I like to read those things, they appeal to the ultimate romantic who is in me. But Alex is also a character who thinks and before throws himself in a relationship with Shawn, he works very hard trying to drive him back. Shawn instead is the dream of every woman, and man maybe: attentive and loving, the right dose of push and comprehensive attitude.It's really interesting to read the dichotomy between Shawn, with his bulky body, who is instead the more feely touching and exuberant in the couple, and Alex, who I envision like the classical prim and proper character, who seems cold and aloof, but when they threaten his lover, he reacts like a poisonous snake: silent but deadly.Only one remarks, very minimal indeed: T.D: McKinney is very good in writing the sex scenes, build them with a growing pathos, but she shut the doors in the apex... why does she not let peep in a little more?","05 18, 2008",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,A Matter Of Necessity by T.D.

1734,B00189ZCY6,"[5, 5]",5,"After working undercover as gay lovers for the better part of a year, returning back to their lives wasn't easy for FBI Special Agents Alex Ware and Shawn Matthews, especially when it turns out Shawn wants to continue being Alex's lover.  Shawn has been in love with Alex for years, but out of respect for their friendship and working environment, he never revealed his feelings.  Their undercover assignment was fate telling him this was meant to be, and Shawn took full advantage of the opportunity to finally show Alex how much he loved him.Alex never thought of himself as gay and had even less of a clue that Shawn might be gay. This was an assignment and you did whatever was needed to survive.  The fact that he actually liked kissing Shawn and his body came alive every time Shawn touched him only made their undercover identities more believable.  Once the sting was over and they made their case, things would go back to normal, so Alex believed.A Matter of Necessity was a romantic comedy with added suspense and drama.  Shawn was a lovesick puppy who drove Alex absolutely batty and I loved every minute of it.  Who wouldn't want this gorgeous g-man with a sexy Australian accent declaring to anyone who would listen how much he loves you?  Alex wanted to believe he didn't want Shawn, but he knew he would be lying.  He wanted Shawn just as much as Shawn wanted him, but Alex was afraid of the stigma of being gay.  I did feel for Alex and his struggle to come to terms with his attraction to another man, and Shawn's sweet, lovingly aggressive pursuit of him only added to his struggle.  Even though Shawn and Alex took a while to see eye to eye about their relationship, they never lost respect for one another as teammates or their fierce protectiveness of each other.  The reactions of their other teammates from the Bureau to their relationship was a mixed bag, with some reactions fitting perfectly to the comedic tone of the story.

1735,B00189ZCY6,"[1, 1]",3,"FBI Special Agent Alex Ware and his partner, Special Agent Shawn Matthews are in deep trouble. Deep undercover to try to nail a particularly offensive weapons trafficker who doesn't trust nor do business with sexually straight people, they're forced into an intimacy that Alex hadn't anticipated - but what really makes him worry is just how much he enjoys the six month deep cover operation. What shocks him is when his Aussie partner and friend, Matthews, comes clean on both his bi-sexuality AND his interest in Alex. An interest that supersedes any work-related cover op.And from that point on, Alex's life - as neurotic and repressed as it was - turns on its ear and becomes uncomfortable, uncertain, and wracked with yearning. In short, utterly unrecognizable.Shawn is adorable in his open devotion to Alex, and Alex is quirky and frustrating in turns as he struggles with his fear and sexual confusion.

Survivors band into safe communities and evolve their own rules.  When a shape-shifting wolf/man is cast out of his tribe, he struggles to survive alone.  Mason finds sanctuary in an ocean cove and slowly builds new relationships with another shape-shifter dolphin/woman and a boy suffering from radiation poisoning.  Mason learns more about his own skills and his role in saving his people from a future catastrophe.  His lover cannot leave the ocean but Mason must make the arduous journey back to his tribe and deliver an important message.The author's beautiful prose and imaginative storyline brings this tale to life.  She makes the reader understand how a wolf hunts and see an underwater world.  The story may be filled with ""magical beings"" but it's set in our own future.  It's not the typical werewolf story, nor is it entirely a bleak Mad Max type of world.  There is hope and redemption for people who can learn to adapt and accept love and kindness.I searched out a novel featuring wolves and I was delighted with this novel.  I recommend the book to anyone who loves animals and imagines what it would be like to become one.  This may be the first story of a series, but each book stands alone.

Go to a Catholic School, attending an all-girls college, and eventually graduating with her teacher's degree. However, Millie's father, Harold, doesn't want her to teach in Appalachia, where Millie has dreamt of teaching since childhood, instead he would rather her become a replacement for his secretary.It's not until they visit Moose Falls, Montana for a week trip, commending  Millie's recent graduation (yet it's disguised as a business venture for her father), when Millie truly allows to LET-IT-ALL-HANG-LOOSE!She meets Johnny Pickett, at the infamous boathouse from ""Letter to a Secret Lover,"" that his father owns and he is currently employed at. It was LOVE at first sight, for both of them. Nonetheless, Johnny is not what Harold would ever consider boyfriend material for Millie. The boy from the wrong side of the tracks, or in his case the boy who went to war, and returned a man.There is an instant attraction to Johnny and Millie, one that cannot be extinguished by anyone who gets in their way, especially Harold.

He sees forever and is anxious to grab onto that dream with every ounce of feeling he has.Johnny and Millie each know that their time together is short.  Millie's father is adamant that she become what he wants her to be and teaching is not part of the plan - neither is a man like Johnny.  When it is time for Millie to leave Montana, Johnny hopes he can convince her to stay because while he might not be the richest or the best choice for a husband, he has one thing that other men do not.

Before the night ended she ended up passing out and landing in the arms of Brock, a handsome Navy sailor.From that point they became friends.

He had withdrew from his family many years before because of a tragic accident. He thought his family blamed him. They didn't, they just wanted to be a part of his life. I really felt the emotions when he visited with his family.

What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again.

The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences.

They are about finding true happiness and dealing with family and issues that happen within families.  Each sibling gets their own story.Cal is the oldest brother; he hires his ex-wife Penny to re-vamp the family's flagship restaurant that used to be the pride of the family and now is on the edge of closure. Penny is a popular new and upcoming chef in the area but does not have enough money to start her own restaurant or start a family (even if it is on her own) she desires. She accepts Cal's offer in exchange, she has a few stipulations of her own. This story is about second chances, very sweet.Walker is the third brother and an ex-marine.  He leaves the military after his experience at war and comes home with ""baggage"" and needs to adjust to his new life.  His story is about adjusting, learning to trust others and allowing others to love him.Reid is the middle brother.  He was an ex-athlete who retired too early because of an injury.  He is used to his playboy ways and finds himself running the family owned sports bar.  He has problems with commitment as well as maintaining relationships that last longer than one night.  He hires Lori to take care of his grandmother.  Lori is the first woman who did not throw herself at him, so he is intrigued by her.I really enjoyed this bundle.

The bundle includes three novels, each dedicated to one of the three boys who are in search of goals for their own lives and in the process find love and in a way and acceptance of their grandmother- a tyrant.  Watching the transformation of this grandmother from a tyrant to a loving individual is a theme that runs through all four books. (TEMPTING is the story of the sister but is not included in the bundle.)DELICIOUS details the rekindling of love and marriage of Cal Buchanan and Penny Jackson - an exceptional chef.  They obviously had married at a young age, divorced, and are now finding their way back to each other.IRRESISTIBLE is my favorite and most enjoyable.  Walker Buchanan is a warrior who returns home seeking peace and finds the joy of love and the need to rescue  a young single mother and her daughter.SIZZLING is funny and entertaining as a playboy (Reid Buchanan) becomes interested in a woman who is very unlike his other conquests.  Their interactions are hilarious.I liked  these novels  because they provided an insightful picture of women who were  determined, independent, and loving.

For once it's Jacob who's having difficulties in his case and Victor (with a distressed Lisa) come to the rescue. In the previous books Jacob was the one in control, but in this book the single-mindedness with which he pursues both the resolution of his case and Victor borders on possession. Victor for once seems to be able to assert himself, even the way he embraces his jealousy was a surprise for me. He no longer accepts things at their face value, on the contrary, he questions his future and his past and he begins to handle his psychic ability.Jacob and Victor are changing and I really want to see what they become in the next book.","10 25, 2010",A1RXR105ND8OSH,manutwo,Another incredible episode in this awesome series!,1287964800
1850,B001BRD238,"[1, 1]",5,"Psycops is one of my favorite urban fantasies and Secrets is my favorite in the series thus far. Jordan Castillo Price has created a fun world, with interesting mysteries and with funny (yes, here is that word again) and sexy characters. Despite being urban fantasy, the characters and the setting are written in very a realistic manner and despite having a romance storyline throughout the books and the series, the romance does not overwhelm the storyline.The setting is Chicago and unlike another of my favorite urban fantasy authors that sets his books in Chicago, Jordan Castillo Price gets Chicago right. Throughout the Psycops series there are 4 key characters. Vic is the main character who is police officer. He is extremely insecure, socially awkward, completely jealous of his boyfriend's former lover yet still very endearing. Vic has an absent partner, Lisa - a very funny and loving person. Then we have Jacob, Vic's serious boyfriend and Jacob's partner Carolyn. Now comes the urban fantasy part of the series - Vic, Lisa and Carolyn each possess different psychic skills and as a result, are employed by police departments to assist in solving crimes. Jacob is not psychically talented but he is very much interested in people who are. Much of the series centers on Vic dealing with his ""talent"", which is seeing and communicating with ghosts, using his talent to solve a crime and the interplay of Vic's relationship with Jacob.The strength of the series to me is the incredibly complex characters Ms. Price writes, along with witty humor. When I am reading any one book in this series I am literally laughing out loud and marking excerpt after excerpt. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves urban fantasy, mysteries or just self-effacing humor. Below are some excerpts from Secrets I particularly liked:(Vic commenting on the new home that he and his boyfriend moved in to and of which he spent the recent few days attempting to organize - unsuccessfully): ""When I got home from work, the cannery looked like an actual dwelling instead of a warehouse that'd been organized by a nearsighted drunk.""""A flicker of actual interest registered in the receptionist's eyes.  `Third floor, Detective.'  And if she noticed that Lisa was dressed in a mishmash of men's sweats, she didn't so much as blink over it.""""the longer I sat there, the closer I was to trying another sip of that decaf coffee.  I stood up and wondered if I was supposed to walk around and pull Lisa's chair out for her, but she was on her feet and bussing her own tray before I even had my own chair pushed in.""""I looked at Jacob.  He was watching me.  Still smiling.  I did my best to telepathically scream, `What the hell?' I don't think he received it.""""How could he do this to us? To me.  To either of us.  We were all in on it, all four of us.  Lisa might survive women's prison if she joined a Mexican gang.  Carolyn wou8ld probably be a smear on the wall within the first week.  I could squeak by if I was still good at being invisible.  But Jacob would be a big trophy kill, shanked by some tough guy looking to prove himself, probably beaten and tortured first.  Jesus Christ.""""We walked more slowly carrying our steaming hot cups of coffee with their helpful warnings printed on the side.""Warning:  The book contains explicit m/m sexual scenes.","12 13, 2011",AFGQLBLB5ZNWI,"Regina ""Regina""",Funny Urban Fantasy Series,1323734400

His boyfriend, Jacob, is also a PsyCop, but he's the non-psychic half of a separate detective team in a different precinct. Vic rates as a level five medium (the scale goes to seven), and he's able to easily hear and see the spirits of the deceased who have not moved on yet. He also has a tendency to abuse his medications, but hey, if you kept seeing murders reenacted, you would too.""Secrets"" is a great read. We delve deeper into Vic like we never have before. His relationship with Jacob is being strained by both internal and external forces. He's being pressured to have a house-warming for his new place, but since he and Jacob aren't officially ""out"" on the force, he starts to more closely contemplate he and Jacob can or will be perceived by their peers. Also, he's come to discover that there's very little information about him on the Internet. None, actually. Someone, or some group, is going through great lengths to erase any mention of him anywhere.The characters are deep and complex. Victor's narration is addictive and compelling (and wittily sarcastic throughout). Romantic encounters are charged with eroticism and passion. This book is a little different from the rest in that it doesn't have as conclusive an ending. The ending is the obvious jumping-off point of the next book in the series, ""Camp Hell"". Being enjoyable in of itself, ""Secrets"" also serves to build great momentum for the conclusion found in ""Camp Hell"", making the two novels combined an incredibly enjoyable and passionate experience.

Cynthia Beller and Lee Maxwell understand that first hand as her father Claymore and Lee, accountants at the same firm working the blood money of the Kurev mob, tried to quit at different times.  Nine years ago Claymore and his family except for his daughter Cynthia were murdered; three years ago, Lee survived the hit, but his wife and daughter were killed.  Each of the survivors vowed separately vengeance.They meet for the first time as Cynthia having just finished a kill is about to leave when Lee enters the abode to assassinate the same thug.  They encounter one another twice more before agreeing they have the same list and strategic BHAG.  They agree to team up to destroy the Kurev family by dividing up the kills.

The vivid story line is action-packed especially with the scenes of the kills.  However, A.J.

Claymore Beller was an accountant for the Russian mafia, until the day he tried to turn them over to the IRS, resulting in the murder of his entire family, and of Claymore; or so they thought. Claymore's youngest daughter Cynthia survives and makes it her mission to get vengeance on the men who killed her family.Lee Maxwell's family was also killed by the Russian mafia for his own betrayal. He, like Cynthia, yearns to get vengeance for the deaths of his wife and daughter; and upon meeting, they decide to make the mafia pay for their crimes. Law enforcement and the media refer to them as the ""Grudge Ninja"".Owen Dunham has been following the ""Grudge Ninja"" case, but none of the evidence/profiles seem to get him any closer to apprehending the suspects. Until he figures out their motive, leaving him to decide whether the ""Grudge Ninja"" has the right to deal out payback, or if  it's his sworn duty to report them.Review:After reading A.J. Scudiere's Resonance, I was excited to read Vengeance, especially after reading the book blurb. The characters were very unique and well developed, and the plot was definitely solid, two of the many reasons that the book took off as soon as I started reading. I love a good thriller, but most times I find them predictable, so the fact that I was constantly on my toes trying to figure out what was going to happen earned this book huge Brownie points. I also appreciated the level of detail, particularly the grittiness, violence, and gore associated with the pairs' vendetta. I wouldn't be surprised to see this as a movie or as the plot in one of the many crime shows currently on television. This fast-paced thriller is definitely on my recommended list!Rating: On the Run (4.5/5)*** I received this book from Griffyn Ink (JKS Communications) in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","10 29, 2011",A34CKST8ITIORZ,"The Paperback Pursuer ""TPP""",Necessary vengeance...,1319846400
1901,B001BXN5HA,"[1, 1]",5,"Vengeance by A.J. Scudiere was one of two books I got from Scudiere's publisher for review.  I read Resonance first, and really enjoyed it.  I had saved Vengeance for last because it was written after Resonance and I didn't know if it was a follow-up with the same characters.  I quickly found out...  it's not.  It's *completely* different, and *really* good.  I had a harder time putting this one down than the first.  I'd have been perfectly happy had it gone even longer than its 400 pages.Lee Maxwell was an accountant with a nice happy family.  That is, until he discovered that he was working for a business run by the mafia.  His attempt to contact the authorities and leave his job only led to the gruesome death of his wife and daughter.  He went off the grid, buried his identity, and started working on getting revenge for the killings.  During one of his operations, he runs into another killer, ""Sin"", who is young, female, dressed in leather, and an expert in knives and slow, painful deaths.  It quickly becomes obvious that they have the same purpose in life...  revenge on the mafia and other assorted lowlifes who need to be stopped one way or another.  Owen Dunham, the FBI agent on the case, has to figure out who the ""Grudge Ninja"" is, and why ""he"" is killing all these people.  But should the truth be known, he'd rather allow the killings to continue, as it's a swift and deadly form of frontier justice.  Lee and Sin have to come to some sort of arrangement in order to stay out of each other's way and maximize their efforts.  Why should they both spend time researching the same target, only to find out the other one got there first for the kill?  But Sin has her own dark history that drives her revenge, and opening up to another person is not something she's able to do.  The revenge killings reach a crescendo as the FBI starts to get their first real evidence left behind at the scene.  The question becomes whether Lee and Sin will finish their list before the FBI (or the mafia) gets to them first...The story starts out from three very different perspectives, that of Sin, Lee, and Owen.  And it's not clear at first why Lee is gunning down scum, and why Sin is leaving dead bodies with multiple cuts and slices, complete with crime documentation, all wrapped up (literally) in a big red bow.  Dunham has his own issues, as he really wants to get out of the business and take time to enjoy his wife and daughter before she tires of his demanding job and leaves him.  But once Sin and Lee start to confront each other, the story and characters really start to jell.  Neither of them want to trust each other, but neither of them wants to eliminate the other, either.  This tentative truce gives way to the beginning of trust, all to seek vengeance against those who have destroyed their lives.  I was also quite satisfied with the ending, as I wasn't looking forward to how I *though* it was going to conclude.Very dark, plenty of action, and character interaction that was stellar...

1902,B001BXN5HA,"[1, 1]",4,"This is the second book by Ms. Scudiere that I've read, and what has struck me the most is how different her books are from one another. This not only applies to plot lines and characters, but also to pacing and style. She created a new, wholly different reading experience with this book compared to the last one I read.What drew me in immediately were the two main characters, Lee and Cyn (or Sin, as she is also called). They are brutal yet endearing killers out to get revenge for the wrongful death of family members. They are cold at first, hard for the reader to understand, but this soon changes. When they finally begin to work together, as a team, the way the author builds their relationship is worth the entire book. I was so amused by their interactions, taking this book from a plot-driven thriller to a deeper level.  The plot itself is fun, fast-paced (although it could have done with a bit of trimming of some fight scenes), and the reader feels in good hands as the author weaves her story together. There are many moments of tension, including sexual tension, which send the reader's heart beating just a bit faster. There is also a wealth of combat and self-defense research in these pages, obviously demonstrating the care the author took to be as accurate as possible with the violence.This is a fun story that I can recommend without issue.

I've way overspent my book buying budget since getting a kindle so had to focus on free down loads recently and frankly,  even for free most are too expensive - they are a waste of time!  So I was really pleased with this. There is erotic tension and angst between Jenesta and her husband, Roarke.  She's not quite clear why he married her,  but she loves him,  and he's gorgeous but so gentle in bed.  He has dreams and desires he dares not bring to her... until she stumbles into his secret chamber,  and all is revealed.Actually the entire piece is basically a set up to the chamber scene,  the chamber scene,  which is entirely sexual and not hard core bdsm,  more light spanking and bondage,  and then ramifications of the chamber scene.

He believes his appears makes people view him as a hideous beast.Lila will do anything to make sure her father is happy and healthy.

I think that part of the story would have been better received by readers if Lila did not give into to Hunter's demands until she was ready.  Yes Lila agreed to the deal, yes she knew she would had to eventually fulfill her obligations and yes she was attracted to Hunter but Lila should have been able to set the pace for their relationship and not Hunter.  I feel that the author should have given that power to Lila and not Hunter and that is why other reviewers had issues with.Because of the Lila's first night I had a hard time reading the sex scenes.

Bursting into Hunter Jamison's office to demand he cease and desist, Lila was taken aback by what he demanded in exchange for her father's shop.Disfigured in a car accident Hunter Jamison felt he lost everything that mattered when he lost his looks.  He knew no woman would want to be with him if he wasn't rich and powerful, and even then his money wasn't enough for some when faced with having to look at his scarred features on a daily basis.  When Lila stormed into his office with her fiery temper and beauty to match he wanted her like he's never wanted any other woman before, and knew the only way she would want him was to proposition her using her father as leverage.Mistress to the Beast is a cute twist on the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale.  I really liked Lila, she's a straightforward tell it like it is type of woman.  And even though she succumbed to Hunter's wishes in order to help her father she never held her tongue when it came to telling Hunter what she thought of him.  My feelings for Hunter waffled a bit.

And in this arrangement he flat out told her he wanted to have sex with her in exchange she got what she wanted. He gave her WEEKS to back out and thought she would, she didn't. Also, even up until the point where he was touching her he told she could back out. There was no holding down and raping. She was suprised(and ashamed) herself she WANTED to have sex with him. And even after the first time he continued to tell her she could back out of the deal. Was he a little crude(he was crude when he made the offer,she shouldn't have been shocked) yes, stern, yes.

And I know that Lila pretty much prostituted herself out to Hunter to save her father's business but, surprisingly, I really enjoyed this book. It was just a well written story.  Parts that would normally make me roll my eyes somehow didn't.  Even though Hunter is demanding and seemingly merciless to Lila in the beginning, the author does a good job of getting us inside his head so we know he's not just being a jerk for being a jerk's sake.  In a way he was right,  it was a business arrangement and they both knew why she was there.  Lila is no pushover and I found her resolve refreshing without being overbearing.  The sex scenes are HOTTTT, yes, even when Lila can't stand him or so she thinks.  I loved the gradual progression of their friendship and the realization of their feelings.  Loved the scenes with Lila and the dogs, which allowed Hunter to first get a glimpse into his feelings for Lila and I enjoyed their dinner conversations.  When things got comfortable between them, it gave me the warm fuzzies.  I pretty much loved everything about the book. I knocked one star off because I thought that the way that Hunter chose to end their contract was unnecessarily lame and only served to throw in a twist. There was no need for that and it was the only thing that spoiled the book for me.  Of course, they got back together so all's well that ends well.This is definitely a book that I will read  many times over.

I have read many techno-thrillers and it is easy to get burned out with them. Unfortunately, in most top-selling techno-novels, the technical stuff can get a bit boring and easily clog up the plot.Also, as a practicing and ""born again"" Christian, I was a little unsure how in the world an author could meld the Christian aspect with a technical thriller. Would it be ""hokey"" or would it beat the reader to death? I should not have worried!I must admit, this is a phenomenal story, outstanding characters, and many may find a lot in their own lives mirrored here! The author sure ""knows"" people and their inner thoughts! The plot is superbly scary with North Korea as the antagonist. Extremely plausible story line. It grips you from the very beginning and goes to the last page. One more thing, it is also a ""love"" story!This, being the author's only fiction book, has me amazed. Clancy, Weber, and other techno-writers better watch out if this guy ever decides to go full-time fiction writing!Lastly, as a Christian, I was absolutely absorbed in the Biblical aspects and quotes. If you are not a practicing Christian, read the book anyway. You won't be put off, and may learn a thing or two!If you are a practicing Christian, you will surely shed a few heart-felt tears! I did!

Warwick is masked muscle for a corrupt businessman as he saves up for the revenge of the death of his parents. When they meet up, sparks fly and worlds tremble.Icy Heat isn't going to win any ""best written book ever"" awards, but I really liked it. And I don't usually like or read futuristic sci/fi novels. Definitely character driven, this story is way more about the people, Aidan and Warwick, than it is about world building or plot development - and that's okay. I wasn't expecting it to be heavy in those areas. But what it IS is surprisingly GOOD with the characters.Aidan is a control freak and has a history of not caring at all for physical contact. She's got a deep love and sense of obligation for her brother Zach, who is addicted to gambling and racking up big debt. I like that she's strong and smart without being a total bitch, and I was actually impressed with a particular scene in which she has to deal with the reality of killing a man. It wasn't focused on for long, but that there was any thought at all given to the complex emotions such an action stirs up, however accidental the killing, was a surprisingly fresh change on the kick-ass and almost conscienceless killer heroines of most urban fantasy/sci fi stuff I read.Warwick is scarred and damaged from those scars, keeping his face and body hidden as his cold heart and colder life is given over to exacting revenge on the man responsible for his parents death and the scars he keeps hidden. When he meets Aidan and starts to spend time with her, his vulnerability shines through and makes him eminently likable. He really is what made me like the story as much as I did. The childlike confusion and wild hope when Aidan accepts him, scars and all, was so endearing.There were huge gaps in the plot and I would've loved more definition in the world building, more glimpses of Aidan's and War's past, but it's a short book, more novella length, and for what's there, I was satisfied that the core of the story was well represented.

An answer that is mutually beneficial to him and his new bride, and that will hopefully finally quell the gay rumors swirling around Hollywood's latest superstar. Kiona would never have guessed she would have to take such drastic measures as to marry a stranger but if it's between that and losing the home and the man she loves she's willing to do what ever it takes. Nothing prepared Kiona or Mitch for the instantaneous attraction that resulted in their initial meeting or the interesting secret the love of her life Kol has been keeping from her. A secret that just might help the union between three people become a triad made in heaven. That's if they can protect each other from Kiona's manipulative father before he wrecks all of their lives for good.In a story that shows what people are willing to do during desperate situations, Kabana Heat entices readers with the beauty and allure of the Hawaiian Islands and its exotic inhabitants. From the first page the stage is set when Hollywood actor meets island vixen and even as she tries to fight the heat they produce just from being near each other, Mitch is not so willing to loose a chance at experiencing how her passionate nature would translate in the bedroom. In steps the jealous and also bi-sexual lover of the heroine and this book takes off on one emotional situation after another. Feelings are dangerous enough without adding in jealousy, hurt and meddling parents who won't let go. Titania Ladley did an interesting job of setting of these three and the only thing I would have liked to see differently maybe a slower build-up between the two men. It was a little hard to swallow that two men who were so far in the closet would jump out within one meeting. Outside of that little hiccup this is really a flaming hot m&eacute;nage that sizzles the fingers for sure!IndyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","07 22, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Kabana Heat,1248220800

Watchers have one mission in life; to hunt and eliminate Rogue vampires and Trigg just wants to be left alone and do his job.  But he can&#8217;t seem to harden his heart against the petite woman who looks so lost standing in the rain.  He knows that that a future for them is impossible, she&#8217;s human, he&#8217;s a vampire, but she&#8217;s someone special. But the past is catching up and it has a way of changing destinies.This steady to fast paced plot keeps the reader engaged from beginning to end with well written scenes, vivid images and great compelling characters.  The author does such a fantastic job of giving these characters life that the reader can&#8217;t help but become enamored and want to know more.  As the reader gets caught up in the lives of Trigg and Robyn they are swept along with the Watchers missions as they battle the rogues and get their adrenalin pumping.The attraction between Trigg and Robyn is such a sweet passion that burns super hot at the same time.  The author conveys that chemistry and their relationship with such intensity that it captures the imagination.

You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn, as well as the reader. As the story goes on, it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him, in hopes of having more of a connection with him.

Those are only a few words I can use to describe Trigg, a vampire who has sworn to protect civilization from the rogues of his kind.After escaping years of abuse from Jack, the last thing Robyn was looking for was another man trying to control her, yet that is exactly what she got. Who wouldn't want to take care of a starving, visibly abused female like Robyn? Trigg only wanted to make her evening a little easier by purchasing her a real meal, but that one meal turned into a lifetime.Your heart will immediately go out to Robyn in this story. I was a little concerned that the love story was about an eighteen year-old, because that seemed a little too young in my mind but it worked well since Robyn was forced to grow up fast due to the abuse she lived with. I also enjoyed the way her previous circumstances made her adapt to Trigg and the other Watchers' way of life easily.Trigg, like many men in these types of novels, is your typical Alpha male. He would have to be in order to be a Watcher for his kind. Only around Robyn can he allow himself to show his softer side. So between Robyn's need for protection, and his need to loosen up, they come together wonderfully.The plot line was phenomenal. The way everything tied in together was perfect. The story was constantly moving forward and kept me turning page after page. It's one of those books where you say to yourself this is the last chapter I'll read, but yet you keep going until you realize you've read the entire book. It also sets you up perfectly for the next book in the series which I cannot wait to read.This was a great love story between two well-deserving characters that you definitely do not want to miss. I highly recommend Midnight Reborn.","05 13, 2010",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...","Dark, mysterious and oh so sexy.",1273708800

Her life is a struggle on some levels, but that is nothing compared to what happens when her mom hooks up with Jake Carter. Then both of their lives take a turn for the worse. The two women are transported into a living hell of extreme physical and emotion abuse.Ms. McEntire's portrayal of these particular scenes is gut wrenching. It was written so well that I actually had to put the book down and have a moment of tears for what the story of these two women represents. It is important that the reader make it through this piece because it really lays the foundation for what Robyn goes through and the young woman she becomes.Just when Robyn thinks there is no hope, she gets a break and makes her escape from Texas to Kentucky. She may have escaped one danger, but lands in the lap of something potentially more deadly. She takes up with a group of Watchers who are actually vampires sworn to protect civilian vampires and humans from rogue vampires.It is an excellent story about despair, newfound hope, personal discovery, and love, filled with a good amount of action.

It was absolutely wonderful and the characters will steal your heart :)Brace yourself when you start to read this book. The beginning will have you an emotional wreck.  It sure did me. I was so angry and sad all at the same time. I felt absolutely horrible for Robyn and all that she went through. She endured a lot of abuse and it really got to me.Robyn was a very strong young lady. She went through things that most people wouldn't survive yet she kept going and doing the best that she could.  When she meets Trigg, I immediately adored him. He is so very charming and mysterious. But then you learn that he's so much more. He is very caring and has a really big heart especially when it comes to Robyn. I loved how as soon as he laid eyes on her he was protective of her and wanted to do nothing but help her and show her that not everyone was going to hurt her. Everything about him will make you love him.""Before you came into my life. I wanted nothing and no one. I lived day in and day out caring only about my mission to seek out and destroy Rogues. You have shown me something I have never felt before-love. I almost lost you and I couldn't bare it. Will you have me as your mate?""Then she meets Trigg's friends, Vane and Rayne. They both welcome her just as Trigg did and accept her in their lives. They all help her to grow and show her the good that is in the world. They all help her to open up her mind and she finally feels safe and at home with them.I really enjoyed seeing their love for one another grow and that no matter what they learned about each other they still wanted to be with one another. Even when she discovers who Trigg really is, she isn't afraid of him and trusts him.  I loved and mean loved getting to know about the watchers and vampires in this book. The guys are all three amazing and I instinctively loved all of them.  I loved all of the characters in this book with the exception of those who hurt Robyn and her mother.I was so glad when Robyn met Rosa, Darla, Phillip, & Abigail. They all pretty much became like family to her, she finally had friends and that made me so very happy. Rosa was great to Robyn from the start and helped her out which made me love her that much more.Now brace yourself for the end of the book as well. I couldn't help it, I cried because of what happened. Robyn truly had one of the biggest hearts and very courageous which she shows near the end when she saves Darla & Abigail. I was so happy that Robyn gets to see her mother again. Even though she's faced with a decision that could forever change her life. I don't want to give too much away, but I was so rooting for a happy ending at this point and hoping that Trigg and Robyn would get the ending they so much deserved. Thankfully the more I read the happier I got. I was beyond ecstatic for the two of them.I can't wait to get to read the next book in this series so I can see where things go for Vane and Rosa because I loved both of them in this one.","10 5, 2013",A1FOA6ZJTM31O3,VernaDene,Completely Adore Trigg!!,1380931200
